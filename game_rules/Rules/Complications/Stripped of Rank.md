#### Stripped of Rank

You were trained as an officer, but you no longer serve. Whether you fled from a battle, were dishonorably discharged, or defected from an evil army, you make your own way in the world now—though your military training will never truly leave you.

**Benefit:** You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Issue Order
>
> *"Move or die, folks."*
>
> | **Ranged**       | **Main action** |
> | ---------------- | --------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One ally** |
>
> **Effect:** The target can use a triggered action to take a main action, a maneuver, or a move action.
>
> **Special:** If you have the Strike Now tactician ability, the target can use a free triggered action instead of a triggered action to gain the benefit of this ability.

**Drawback:** Rather than attracting followers at 3, 6, 9, and 12 Renown, you can attract followers only when your Renown reaches 4, 8, 12, and 16. See [Renown](#page-364-6) in [Chapter 13: Rewards](#page-327-1).
