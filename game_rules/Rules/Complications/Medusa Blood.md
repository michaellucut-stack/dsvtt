#### Medusa Blood

Your mother and father never saw eye to eye. You know this because your father is still alive and your mother is a medusa. This made your childhood difficult, and now it's making your adulthood complicated as well.

**Benefit:** You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Stone Eyes
>
> *Your looks don't kill—they petrify.*
>
> | **Magic, Ranged, Strike** |     **Main action** |
> | ------------------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**          | **🎯 One creature** |
>
> **Power Roll + Might or Presence:**
>
> - **≤11:** 2 damage; M < WEAK, slowed (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; M < AVERAGE, slowed (save ends)
> - **17+:** 6 damage; M < STRONG, slowed (save ends)
>
> **Effect:** This ability has no effect on a creature who can't see you or who purposefully avoids looking at your eyes. A creature reduced to 0 Stamina by this ability is turned to inanimate stone.

**Drawback:** Out of combat, you use your Stone Eyes ability on anyone who meets your gaze, whether you intend to or not. Your companions know not to make eye contact, but strangers are likely to trigger the ability unless you cover your eyes.
