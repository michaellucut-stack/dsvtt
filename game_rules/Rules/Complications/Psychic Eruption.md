#### Psychic Eruption

In times of stress, you get headaches. Psionic energy builds up in your mind until you feel as though your head might explode. And if you're not careful, it actually does explode, radiating psychic waves that harm friends and enemies alike.

**Benefit:** You have the following heroic ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Psychic Blast (Special Heroic Resource Cost)
>
> *Psionic energy bursts from your body in an iridescent shimmer.*
>
> | **Area, Psionic** |                  **Main action** |
> | ----------------- | -------------------------------: |
> | **📏 3 burst**    | **🎯 Each creature in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** Using this ability costs all your Heroic Resource.
>
> **Power Roll + Your Highest Characteristic Score:**
>
> - **≤11:** 1 psychic damage for each Heroic Resource you spend, to a maximum equal to your level
> - **12-16:** 1 psychic damage for each Heroic Resource you spend, to a maximum equal to your level + your highest characteristic
> - **17+:** 1 psychic damage for each Heroic Resource you spend

**Drawback:** Whenever you become bleeding, frightened, or weakened, you must use Psychic Blast as a free triggered action.
