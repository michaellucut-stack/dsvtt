#### Lightning Soul

You were caught in a storm and struck by lightning—but something saved you from death. Perhaps it was a gods—given miracle, a latent psionic gift, or the magic of a helpful elementalist, but you absorbed the lightning into your body. It's always there now, simmering under the surface.

**Benefit:** Whenever you regain Stamina in combat, you gain 1 surge. Whenever you spend a surge to deal extra damage, you can make that extra damage into lightning damage.

**Drawback:** Whenever you are wet, you have damage weakness 5.
