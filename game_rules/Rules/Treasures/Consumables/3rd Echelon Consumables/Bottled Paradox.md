##### Bottled Paradox

*Liquid constantly swirls within a cut glass bottle that is ice cold to the touch.*

**Keywords:** Magic, Potion

**Item Prerequisite:** A month's lifespan from the creator or another willing creature, ground sapphire

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 180

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you can drink this potion or throw it up to 10 squares. If you drink it, you choose a test you made in the last minute, then reroll that test repeatedly until the outcome changes. If the potion is thrown, it creates a 3-cube area of shimmering magic. Any event that took place in that area in the previous minute changes at the discretion of the Director, who has full freedom to decide what happens. The energy then dissipates.
