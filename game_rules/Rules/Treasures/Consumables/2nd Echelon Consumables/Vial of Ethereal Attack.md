##### Vial of Ethereal Attack

*Clear liquid seems to constantly churn within an obsidian vial, even when at rest.*

**Keywords:** Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** A signed agreement with a ghost, a large obsidian disk

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Anjali

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 90

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you throw this vial up to 10 squares, destroying the vial and creating a 2-cube ethereal vortex centered on the spot where it lands. The vortex dissipates at the end of the encounter or when you dismiss it (no action required). Any creature who enters the vortex for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes 10 psychic damage. At the start of each of your turns, you can move the vortex up to 5 squares (no action required).
