##### Blood Essence Vial

*A brittle glass tube has a ruby set atop it, attached by a hinge.*

**Keywords:** Potion, Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** A ruby purloined from a vampire

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Proto-Ctholl

**Effect:** When you damage an adjacent creature who has blood, you can capture the target's life essence in this vial (no action required). Record the damage you dealt. You can capture life essence in the vial only once. As a maneuver, you drink the contents of the vial to regain Stamina equal to half the damage dealt. If you spend 1 Heroic Resource while you drink, you regain Stamina equal to the damage dealt. Once you drink from the vial, it crumbles to dust.
