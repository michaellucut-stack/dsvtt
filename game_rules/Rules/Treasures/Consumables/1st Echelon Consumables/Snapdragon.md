##### Snapdragon

*This delicate orange blossom has a sickly-sweet smell.*

**Keywords:** Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** Fifty snapdragon seeds

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Yllyric

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 45 (yields 1d6 + 1 snapdragons)

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you sniff a magic snapdragon blossom, causing it to whither and making your movements more forceful and explosive. The next damage-dealing ability you use deals an extra 5 damage and gains a +2 bonus to the distance of any forced movement it imposes. If the ability does not impose forced movement, you can push each creature targeted by the ability up to 2 squares.
