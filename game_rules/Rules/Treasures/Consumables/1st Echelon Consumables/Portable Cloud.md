##### Portable Cloud

*This thin glass sphere holds a tiny roiling cloud.*

**Keywords:** Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** A cup of rainwater from a sacred fey grove, plus an optional prerequisite (see below)

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 30 or 45 (see below)

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you throw this delicate glass sphere up to 5 squares, breaking it and creating a 4 cube of fog. The fog dissipates after 10 minutes or if a strong gust of wind created by a storm or magic passes through the area.

Enterprising mages within various thieves' guilds have developed variations of the Portable Cloud. Each variation has a secondary item prerequisite and a project goal of 45.

**Noxious Cloud:** Filled with a green or putrid yellow haze, this sphere spreads a choking, foul-smelling mist when broken. Each creature who enters the cloud for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes 5 poison damage. Additionally, any creature is weakened while in the fog.

**Item Prerequisite:** An ounce of undead flesh. **Thunderhead Cloud:** Small lightning bolts arc around the black cloud in this sphere, which creates a 3 cube of cloud and lightning when broken. Each creature who enters the cloud for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes 5 lightning damage. Additionally, any creature is slowed while in the cloud.

**Item Prerequisite:** A spool of copper wire.
