##### Giant's-Blood Flame

*A small pot is filled with a viscous, ochre oil that smells of sulfur and burnt hair.*

**Keywords:** Magic, Oil

**Item Prerequisite:** One vial of fire giant blood

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 45

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you coat a weapon in this oil and ignite it. The weapon burns persistently and without harming itself until it is extinguished as a maneuver. Whenever you use a weapon ability that deals rolled damage using a weapon that is ignited this way, the ability deals an extra 2 fire damage.

Alternatively, you can use a maneuver to throw the pot up to 5 squares, coating the square where it lands and any creatures or objects in that square with a sticky flammable oil. If the oil takes any fire damage, it burns persistently and deals 5 fire damage at the end of each of your turns to anything it has coated. A creature covered in the oil or who can reach it can use a main action to extinguish the flames and end the effect.

Any fire caused by the oil is extinguished after burning for 1 hour.
