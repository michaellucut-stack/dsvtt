##### Catapult Dust

*A small leather pouch is filled with this fine blue powder.*

**Keywords:** Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** An ounce of witherite crystal

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 45

**Effect:** Catapult Dust was developed as a cost-effective magic siege weapon. As a main action, you pour the dust out in an adjacent unoccupied space to fill an area as large as a 2 cube. At the start of your next turn, the ground at the bottom of the area erupts violently upwards and in a direction of your choice. Any unattended objects in the area, or creatures who have entered the area since the dust was poured, are launched in an arc that is 6 + 1d6 squares long and 3 + 1d6 squares high.
