##### Elixir of Saint Elspeth

*This thick red liquid smells of cinnamon.*

**Keywords:** Magic, Potion

**Item Prerequisite:** An ounce of the blood of Saint Elspeth

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Presence

**Project Goal:** 360

**Effect:** When you pour the elixir onto your forehead as a maneuver, it vanishes and you protect yourself against effects that might harm your body, mind, or soul. For a number of rounds equal to your current Victories, any enemy ability targeting you automatically obtains a tier 1 outcome against you. Additionally, the ability can only deal damage to you, letting you ignore its other effects.
