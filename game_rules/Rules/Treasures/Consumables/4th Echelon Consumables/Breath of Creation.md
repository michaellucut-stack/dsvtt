##### Breath of Creation

*A glass flask holds a roiling storm of astral plasma.*

**Keywords:** Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** The captured breath of a god, an ounce of condensed dreams

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in the First Language

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Intuition or Presence

**Project Goal:** 360

**Effect:** When you inhale the Breath of Creation as a maneuver, you are imbued with cosmic power. You earn 1 Renown, and you create a size 2 portal to a new demiplane in an adjacent square. The demiplane is a 20-cube area whose form and mundane features are chosen by you. The portal appears only to you and creatures you designate, and only you and those creatures can enter the demiplane. When a creature moves into the portal, they emerge from a corresponding portal inside the demiplane, and vice versa. Objects created within the demiplane turn to dust if removed from it.

Each time you use another Breath of Creation, you can create a new demiplane or expand a demiplane you have already created or visited. The size of an expanded demiplane increases by 20, and you create a second portal to the demiplane with a corresponding portal inside.
