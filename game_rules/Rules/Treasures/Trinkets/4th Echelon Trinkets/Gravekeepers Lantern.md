##### Gravekeeper's Lantern

*This ancient wooden lantern is inscribed with eldritch runes and stained with dark blood.*

**Keywords:** Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** The powdered jawbone of a powerful spellcaster, wood from a tree marking multiple graves

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Hyrallic

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 600

**Effect:** The Gravekeeper's Lantern can temporarily trap a nonhostile spirit of the dead—either an incorporeal undead or the wandering spirit of a creature who died within the last 30 days—allowing you to interrogate them. Trapping a spirit requires you to be within 10 squares of them and succeed on a hard Intuition test as a main action. Once a spirit is trapped, you make a Presence test to coax them into answering your questions:

- **≤11:** You can ask two questions of the spirit, one of which they must answer fully and honestly.
- **12-16:** You can ask three questions, two of which the spirit must answer fully and honestly.
- **17+:** You can ask five questions, all of which the spirit must answer fully and honestly.

A trapped spirit remains in the lantern for 10 minutes. They remember being trapped by you, and might become hostile thereafter.
