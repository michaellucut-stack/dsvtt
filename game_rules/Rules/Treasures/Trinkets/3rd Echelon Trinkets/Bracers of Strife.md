##### Bracers of Strife

*Each of these metallic blue bracers is oversized.*

**Keywords:** Arms, Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** The severed hand of a giant

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Yllyric

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 450

**Effect:** While you wear them in combat, these bracers magically double the size of your hands and any melee weapons you wield, automatically compensating for the extra weight. You gain a +2 damage bonus for any weapon ability that deals rolled damage, and a +1 bonus to the distance you push any target with any weapon ability. This damage bonus adds to the damage bonus granted by other treasures.
