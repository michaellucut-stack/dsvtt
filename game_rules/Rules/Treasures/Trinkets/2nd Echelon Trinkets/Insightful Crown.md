##### Insightful Crown

*Shaped of polished crystal, this shimmering circlet shifts through myriad colors in the presence of strong emotions.*

**Keywords:** Head, Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** One measure of pure crystal, a jarred memory of true joy

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Variac

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 300

**Effect:** While wearing the crown, you gain an edge on Intuition tests made to read the emotions and discern the honesty of other creatures. If you succeed on an Intuition test to read the emotions of another creature within 5 squares, you can ask the Director one question about something the creature knows, which the Director must answer honestly. At the Director's discretion, you might not be able to tap into the creature's deepest secrets this way.
