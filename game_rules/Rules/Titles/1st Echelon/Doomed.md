#### Doomed

*I don't know what it meant, but when I watched her die, I saw a vision. I watched her die and saw my own death. Am I losing my mind?*

**Prerequisite:** You aren't a hakaan but have witnessed the death of a hakaan.

**Effect:** You aren't destined for a meaningful death, but you still might achieve one. When you're reduced to 0 Stamina but remain conscious, you can become doomed. If you do, you can't regain Stamina, you automatically obtain a tier 3 outcome on tests and power rolls, and you don't die until your Stamina reaches the negative of your Stamina maximum. At the end of the encounter, you die.
