#### Owed a Favor

*The Guild's gratitude knows no bounds! We'll repay you in any way we can... short of actually paying you.*

**Prerequisite:** You successfully perform a service for a powerful faction.

**Effect:** The faction will perform one favor for the party, provided it doesn't interfere with the faction's goals.

Additionally, the faction is a good source of information. The Director chooses a skill from the crafting or lore skill groups appropriate to the faction, such as the Criminal Underworld skill for an outlaw gang, the Blacksmithing skill for a blacksmith's guild, or the Society skill for a noble house. While in a settlement where the faction has a presence, you gain this skill if you don't already have it. If you already have the skill, you instead gain an edge on tests made using the skill.
