#### Dwarven Legionnaire

*I have learned much. It might be your courage that inspires others. Watch your opponent's shield as well as their sword. And above all, stand fast, and do not yield.*

**Prerequisite:** You fight alongside three or more dwarves.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Close Formation:* While adjacent to two or more allies, you gain a +2 bonus to stability.
- *Rune of Alarm:* You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to inscribe a magic eye-shaped rune on a surface. The rune sheds light for 2 squares. The rune is dispelled 1 minute after it is activated or if you inscribe the rune elsewhere. The rune activates when an enemy comes within 2 squares of it. When the rune is activated, you wake up if you are nonmagically asleep, and you can perceive through the rune for 1 minute as if you were in its square.
- *Stonemeld:* While adjacent to a stone wall, you can use a maneuver to gain concealment. This concealment lasts until you leave the square or use an ability.
