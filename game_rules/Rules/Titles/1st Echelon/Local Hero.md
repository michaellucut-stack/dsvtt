#### Local Hero

*Your coin won't spend here. The Heroes of Gravesford drink for free in this tavern!*

**Prerequisite:** You save a community from certain destruction.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Easy Marks:* You gain an edge on tests made using skills from the interpersonal and intrigue skill groups when influencing members of a community that you have saved.
- *Local Fame:* You earn 1 Renown.
- *A New Dawn:* Each time you finish a respite while in a community you have saved, the party gains a hero token. This hero token disappears at the end of your next respite if it hasn't been used.
