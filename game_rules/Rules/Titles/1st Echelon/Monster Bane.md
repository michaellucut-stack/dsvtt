#### Monster Bane

*You dare mock Blunwin Mousebane? You think my deed trivial? Ah, but you didn't see the size of the mouse!*

**Prerequisite:** You defeat a leader or solo creature with a Reason score of −2 or lower, such as an arixx.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Beast Bane:* Creatures with the Animal keyword take a bane on strikes made against you.
- *Monster Soother:* You gain an edge on tests made to calm or tame nonsapient creatures.
- *Monster Trophy:* You decorate your equipment with a trophy from a creature you defeated. While the trophy is visible, you gain an edge on tests made to intimidate sapient creatures.
