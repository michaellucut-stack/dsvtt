#### Mage Hunter

*Their power is dangerous. Unnatural. Someone needs to do something.*

**Prerequisite:** You defeat three leader or solo creatures who each have at least one ability with the Magic keyword.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Arcane Dampening:* When resisting potencies from magic abilities, your characteristic scores are considered to be 1 higher than usual.
- *Oh No, You Don't!:* Whenever an adjacent creature uses an ability with the Magic keyword, you can make a free strike against them as a triggered action.
- *Stink of Magic:* As a maneuver, you open your senses to the residue of magic. Until the end of your next turn, you are aware of whether each creature within 5 squares is a construct, an undead, or a creature from another world, and whether they have used a magic ability in the previous hour. Additionally, you can't be surprised by constructs, undead, or creatures from another world.
