#### Master Crafter

*The sword Vanartha has been remade, mightier now than on the day it was forged.*

**Prerequisite:** You complete a downtime project to imbue armor, an implement, or a weapon with a 9th-level enhancement.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Masterpiece:* The armor, implement, or weapon can be imbued a fourth time, with any enhancement the item qualifies for.
- *Research Dividends:* You gain the item prerequisite for an armor, implement, or weapon enhancement of your choice. Additionally, you learn the project source language for that enhancement.
- *Skilled Hands:* You have a skill from the crafting skill group that would have been used during the creation of the prerequisite item. If you already have that skill, you instead gain an edge on tests made using the skill. Additionally, you gain a second skill of your choice from the crafting skill group.
- *Strong Hands Make Light Work:* Whenever you make a project roll, you can use Might as the project roll characteristic.
