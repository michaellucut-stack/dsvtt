#### Noble

*Technically, I'm called Lord Morninghill these days. I did a little favor for Duke Kenway at the Battle of Black Forest.*

**Prerequisite:** A monarch or important noble grants you a noble rank.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *I Know How to Talk to These People:* You gain an edge on Presence tests made to interact with royals, nobles, and their feudal followers, provided they are aware of your noble rank.
- *Noble Splendor:* You earn 1 Renown and 1 Wealth.
- *Retinue:* The number of followers you can recruit increases by two.

**Special:** If you take this title, you might occasionally be called upon to perform duties for the person who granted your noble rank.
