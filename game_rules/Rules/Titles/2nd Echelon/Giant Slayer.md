*Come back here, puny one, and let me crush you!*

**Prerequisite:** You defeat a leader or solo creature with the Giant keyword, such as a fire giant chief.

- *Smallfolk Dodge:* Any creature of size 2 or larger takes a bane on strikes against you.
- *The Harder They Fall:* You have the following ability, which can be paid for using the Heroic Resource of your class.

> - **12-16:** 11 damage; M < AVERAGE, prone and can't stand (save ends)
> - **17+:** 16 damage; M < STRONG, prone and can't stand (save ends)

> **Special:** If the target is size 2 or larger, you gain an edge on this ability.

- *Up the Beanstalk:* You have the Climb skill. If you already have this skill, you instead gain an edge on tests made using the Climb skill. While you're climbing a creature, the creature has a double bane on strikes against you and you have a double edge on tests made to stay on the creature.
