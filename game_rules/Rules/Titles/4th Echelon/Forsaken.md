#### Forsaken

*The quest is done, the enemy is defeated, and the Blade of a Thousand Years has passed from our hands. What do we do with the rest of our lives?*

**Prerequisite:** Your party loses, destroys, or otherwise parts with an artifact.

**Effect:** A characteristic of your choice increases by 1 (to a maximum of 6). Additionally, choose one of the following benefits:

- *Brief Reunion:* While you're winded, you can use a maneuver to summon the artifact to your hand. It disappears at the end of your next turn. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you earn 1 or more Victories.
- *Perfect Protection:* The Director chooses a damage type that is dealt by or thematically related to the artifact—for instance, holy for the Blade of a Thousand Years, psychic for the Encepter, or corruption for the Mortal Coil. You have immunity all to the chosen damage type.
- *Poor Compensation:* Instead of disappearing or otherwise departing, the artifact turns into a trinket or leveled treasure of the Director's choice that has the same approximate shape as the lost item—for instance, any magic sword for the Blade of a Thousand Years, any implement for the Encepter, or a Thief of Joy or any other torque for the Mortal Coil.
