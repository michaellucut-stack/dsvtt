#### Peace Bringer

*There goes Diana, peace bringer. She has won many a victory with her sword, but her greatest deed was convincing two nations to stop fighting.*

**Prerequisite:** You conduct a successful negotiation on which the fate of a nation or a world stands.

- *Hear Me Out:* While you are present in a negotiation, an NPC's starting patience increases by 3 (to a maximum of 5).
