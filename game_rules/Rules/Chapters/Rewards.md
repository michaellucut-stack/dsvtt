# Rewards

Virtue is its own reward... but wouldn't a magic sword also be kind of nice? As heroes adventure, they find and craft treasures even as they are awarded titles, earn renown, attract followers, and amass wealth. This chapter presents all the various rewards a hero can earn during their career! As you read over the rewards within, make note of the treasures and titles your hero would like to earn. Then you can start pursuing them during your adventures.

## Treasures

You've helped save the world! Or at least a corner of that world important to you. Now you deserve the treasures that can help you do so even more efficiently next time. So claim your magic sword, psionic shield, and Catapult Dust, and ride to your next adventure!

Treasures are the supernatural items that heroes find on their adventures, or that they craft themselves to help with their heroics. You might claim a magic whip from a bandit captain or create a psionic necklace that will help you take down a dread cult.

Treasures come in all shapes and sizes, and are broken down into four types.

**Consumables** are the most numerous treasures. These include potions, dusts, and other items that are consumed by you when you activate them. Most consumables can be used only once!

**Trinkets** are treasures with supernatural properties that never fade. These include magic bags, boots, cloaks, gloves, jewelry, and other oddities.

**Leveled treasures** are treasures that become even more powerful in the hands of a higher-level hero. They connect with their user, building a bond that fuels the item's supernatural power. Armor, implements, and weapons are the most common types of leveled treasure.

**Artifacts** are treasures of legendary power that can change or shape an adventure—or even an entire campaign. Each of these game-breaking items is unique, highly coveted, and well guarded.

### Found, Earned, or Crafted

The rules of the game account for worlds where the average person sometimes even the average noble—doesn't have regular access to treasures. There might be an apothecary in the capital city of a region, but they're selling herbal remedies, not supernatural potions. In Vasloria, a town blacksmith isn't selling magic maces, and the local tailor doesn't make psionic capes. There simply aren't enough treasures readily available to create a good trade economy. Word sometimes gets around of mysterious clubs where heroes and treasure seekers can meet up to swap items, but the constant threat of thieves makes such markets difficult to find.

Most treasures are found as part of adventures. Many people concoct dastardly schemes, but only those with the will and power to enact that vision become villains—and acquiring treasures of great power is often part of a villain's plans. As such, the heroes who vanquish those evildoers often get to claim those treasures for themselves. At

other times, generous and well-off individuals such as monarchs and powerful mages can reward treasures as thanks for heroic deeds.

Heroes can also craft their own treasures, forging the tools they need to get the job done using the rules in [Chapter 12: Downtime Projects](#page-307-2). Items that can be crafted have their item prerequisite, project source, project roll characteristic, and project goal (the number of project points needed to complete the project) noted in their descriptions.

#### What Does This Treasure Do?

When a hero finds a treasure, they learn its properties if they examine it for 5 uninterrupted minutes, unless the item's description says otherwise.

<!-- -->
> **Treasure Item Prerequisite**
>
> Each treasure has an item prerequisite necessary for crafting it. The exact nature of many of the materials used as an item's prerequisite is left nebulous so that the Director can more easily work those materials into a campaign. What's a mindspider, and how rare is their silk? That's for the Director to decide, whether they want to drop prerequisite items into their planned adventures or craft an entire side quest around finding them.

#### Wearing Treasures

Many treasures, such as cloaks, jewelry, hats, and boots, must be worn. Unless the Director deems otherwise, these items supernaturally resize themselves to fit the creature using them.

Wearable treasures have keywords that indicate which part of the body they are meant to adorn—Arms, Feet, Hands, Head, Neck, or Waist. The Ring keyword marks treasures typically worn on the finger. You can wear any number of treasures that have the same body keyword as long as the Director deems it reasonable. For example, it might be fine for a four-armed time raider to wear two pairs of bracers, but the Director might decide that the same hero can't benefit from wearing two magic cloaks at once. If the Director decides you're wearing too many treasures with the same body keyword, none of those treasures function.

Though body keywords indicate where a treasure is meant to be worn, treasures can still function if worn on other parts of the body. For example, a hero without ears or who just wants to have a different look might wear an earring as a piercing anywhere else they desire.

If a wearable treasure comes as a set, such as a pair of bracers, boots, or earrings, all items in the set must be worn to gain the treasure's benefits.

#### Wielding Treasures

Some treasures are wielded in the form of weapons or implements. A weapon might have the Light Weapon, Medium Weapon, or Heavy Weapon keywords, or might have a keyword denoting a specific category of weapon (Bow, Polearm, and so forth). An implement might have the Implement keyword or a keyword denoting the type of implement (Orb, Wand, and so forth). Armor is also considered a wielded treasure, with the Light Armor, Medium Armor, or Heavy Armor keywords, or the Shield keyword.

A hero can wield as many weapons, implements, suits of armor, or shields as they can feasibly hold or wear. However, an ability can benefit only from one weapon or implement at a time.

##### Treasures and Kits

To gain the benefits of a weapon or armor treasure, the treasure must have keywords that match the equipment of your kit. For instance, a hero using the Warrior Priest kit can benefit from wearing a heavy armor treasure and wielding light weapon treasures, since those are part of that kit.

If your hero doesn't use a kit, they can't gain benefits from using armor or weapon treasures unless they have a feature that says otherwise, such as the conduit's Prayer of Soldier's Skill.

A weapon's damage bonus only adds to melee abilities if your kit has a melee damage bonus. A weapon's damage bonus only adds to ranged abilities if your kit has a ranged damage bonus.

#### Magic and Psionic Treasures

The Magic and Psionic keywords for treasures refer to how those treasures are created, not how they are used. Just as magic potions and swords aren't limited only to characters who wield magic themselves, the Magic and Psionic keywords don't restrict the use of treasures to only certain types of characters, so that an implement with the Magic keyword can be used to enhance abilities with the Psionic keyword, and vice versa. Treasures that have the Magic or Psionic keyword and are used to enhance an ability don't add those keywords to the ability.

#### Stamina Bonuses and Damage Bonuses

If two treasures give a creature a bonus to their Stamina or a bonus to the rolled damage of their abilities, only the higher bonus applies unless the treasure's description notes otherwise. Stamina bonuses and damage bonuses from consumables ignore this rule, and can be stacked with other Stamina bonuses and damage bonuses granted by treasures.

### Consumables

Consumables are treasures that can be used a limited number of times before they expire, losing whatever makes them supernatural. You can drink a potion once, and when you do so, that's it. It's consumed. Other consumables might have a specific number of charges that can be spent. Once those charges are gone, the treasure is useless.

Consumables are organized by echelon to make life easy for the Director handing them out (see [Echelons of Play](#page-22-0) in [Chapter 1:](#page-17-3) [The Basics](#page-17-3)). As a guideline, a hero should always be able to find consumable treasures or the materials required to craft consumables of their echelon and lower. For example, heroes who are 5th level should be able to find consumables of 1st and 2nd echelon. In some cases, the Director might decide to award consumables of an echelon higher than the heroes' echelon, but such a choice means giving the heroes more power than the encounter-building guidelines in *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)* accounts for.

Your character can carry any number of consumables at a time.

Alternatively, you can use a maneuver to throw the pot up to 5 squares, coating the square where it lands and any creatures or objects in that square with a sticky flammable oil. If the oil takes any fire damage, it burns persistently and deals 5 fire damage at the end of each of your turns to anything it has coated.

Any fire caused by the oil is extinguished after burning for 1 hour.

##### Pocket Homunculus

The homunculus is a creature with Stamina 15, a 0 in all their characteristics, and a speed and stability equal to yours. They appear indistinguishable from you but can't use any abilities.

While you have line of effect to your homunculus, you can use a maneuver to issue them a telepathic command. The homunculus performs the command to the best of their ability. If not commanded, the homunculus mimics your movements and speech. When you move, the homunculus moves with you, matching your pace. The homunculus crumbles to dust after 1 hour or if reduced to 0 Stamina.

A creature who is exposed to blown powder (even if they hold their breath) or consumes a dose of the powder must communicate in only true statements for 1 hour. Additionally, other creatures gain an edge on Intuition and Presence tests made to convince the target to communicate, or to read the target's emotions.

If they are not willing, you instinctively understand that as you start the respite activity and can cease it immediately. The scroll is not consumed, and you can undertake a new respite activity.

A creature with a willing soul returns to life at the end of the respite with full Stamina and half their Recoveries. You regain only half your Recoveries at the end of the respite, and the scroll is consumed.

##### Telemagnet

**Effect:** When you release the larva as a maneuver, it feeds on psychic energy to grow exponentially, creating a 10 wall of larval flesh adjacent to you. The wall can't be created to fill any square occupied by a creature with stability 1 or higher. Each other creature in the wall when it is created is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.

At the start of each of your turns, each creature adjacent to the wall takes psychic damage equal to three times their Intuition score, and you can add 1 square to the wall for each creature who takes this damage.

If you drink it, you choose a test you made in the last minute, then reroll that test repeatedly until the outcome changes. If the potion is thrown, it creates a 3-cube area of shimmering magic. Any event that took place in that area in the previous minute changes at the discretion of the Director, who has full freedom to decide what happens. The energy then dissipates.

While you are within 5 squares of the remains of the creature the effigy is tied to, you can use a maneuver to manually light and burn the effigy and bring the creature back to life. The creature returns to life with Stamina equal to their winded value and 10 temporary Stamina that lasts until the end of their next respite.

This section presents 4th-echelon consumable treasures in alphabetical order.

##### Breath of Creation

*A glass flask holds a roiling storm of astral plasma.*

**Keywords:** Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** The captured breath of a god, an ounce of condensed dreams

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in the First Language

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Intuition or Presence

**Project Goal:** 360

**Effect:** When you inhale the Breath of Creation as a maneuver, you are imbued with cosmic power. You earn 1 Renown, and you create a size 2 portal to a new demiplane in an adjacent square. The demiplane is a 20-cube area whose form and mundane features are chosen by you. The portal appears only to you and creatures you designate, and only you and those creatures can enter the demiplane. When a creature moves into the portal, they emerge from a corresponding portal inside the demiplane, and vice versa. Objects created within the demiplane turn to dust if removed from it.

Each time you use another Breath of Creation, you can create a new demiplane or expand a demiplane you have already created or visited. The size of an expanded demiplane increases by 20, and you create a second portal to the demiplane with a corresponding portal inside.

Additionally, the ability can only deal damage to you, letting you ignore its other effects.

Any creature who enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes 20 fire damage and is dazed until the end of their turn.

### Trinkets

Trinkets are treasures that can be used at will without a reduction in their potency. They generally provide a small benefit, such as allowing you to see farther or become a bit better at picking locks.

Like consumables, trinket treasures are organized by echelon. You can carry any number of trinkets.

#### 1st-Echelon Trinkets

Once you deal this extra damage, your lightning immunity becomes lightning weakness with the same value until the end of the next round. You can't use this triggered action again until this weakness ends.

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you transfer an object of size 1S or 1T held in one hand with another object of the same size that is within 10 squares. The objects change locations instantaneously and without creating any auditory or visual disturbance.

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you call upon the Divine Vine in Yllyric, causing it to extend up to 5 squares from you and attach its jaws to a creature or object, allowing you to use the Grab maneuver at a distance. If the target is grabbed, you can choose to keep the divine vine extended, pull the target adjacent to you, or pull yourself adjacent to the target. The divine vine stays attached to the target until it takes damage from a strike, the target escapes your grab, or you call upon the vine to release the target (no action required).

##### Flameshade Gloves

**Effect:** When you use a move action while wearing these gloves, you can place one hand upon a mundane object as part of that move action. If the object is 1 square thick or less and has open space on the other side (for example, a door or wall), you pull your body through it as though the object wasn't there.

If the object is too thick or has no open space on the other side, your hand becomes stuck inside the object. Removing your hand takes a successful hard Might test made as a main action.

##### Gecko Gloves

*These scaled gloves have palms and fingers covered in near-invisible sticky hairs.*

**Keywords:** Hands, Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** Ten gecko tails

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

The humanoid's appearance reflects the last time you saw them, including whatever they were wearing. Your clothing and gear are transformed into the figure's clothing and gear, absorbed into your body, or retain their original forms, as you determine. If the figure possessed any treasures when you last saw them, they are duplicated as mundane copies while you are transformed.

##### Quantum Satchel

**Keywords:** Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** One uncut opal

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 150

**Effect:** When the brooch is removed from this bag and placed in a container or room, it magically entangles that location to the bag. Any item that can be placed in the Quantum Satchel appears near to the brooch and can be recovered by reaching inside while picturing the desired object. The capacity of the satchel is dictated by the size of the container or room where the entangled brooch is. If an item is removed from the container or room containing the brooch, it can't be retrieved through the satchel.

##### Unbinder Boots

*A pair of ornately embroidered leather boots are covered in images of broken chains.*

If you succeed on an Intuition test to read the emotions of another creature within 5 squares, you can ask the Director one question about something the creature knows, which the Director must answer honestly. At the Director's discretion, you might not be able to tap into the creature's deepest secrets this way.

**Project Goal:** 300

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you touch the key to an adjacent willing, grabbed, or restrained creature and twist the key 90 degrees clockwise. That creature must answer the next three questions they are asked truthfully and fully. If twisted 90 degrees counterclockwise instead, the creature forgets the last 30 minutes they experienced. A creature affected by the key can't be affected again by any Key of Inquiry for 1 year. If the key is ever destroyed, all the memories it has erased are restored. Memories erased by the key can't be restored in any other way.

The image displays floors, walls, and other barriers but doesn't show other objects. It shows representations of any moving creatures on the other side, but not creatures who are still.

##### Stop-'n-Go Coin

*This small, featureless coin is solid green on one side and solid red on the other.*

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

- **2-Green:** You and each ally who starts their turn within 2 squares of you gains a +1 bonus to speed until the end of your next turn.
- **3-Spinning Coin:** Both the red and green effects occur while the coin continuously spins.

The coin must be picked up before it can be used again. If any creature picks up the coin, its effects immediately end.

**Item Prerequisite:** The severed hand of a giant

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Yllyric

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 450

**Effect:** While you wear them in combat, these bracers magically double the size of your hands and any melee weapons you wield, automatically compensating for the extra weight. You gain a +2 damage bonus for any weapon ability that deals rolled damage, and a +1 bonus to the distance you push any target with any weapon ability. This damage bonus adds to the damage bonus granted by other treasures.

##### Mask of Oversight

*This angular electrum mask is set with an excess of eye holes and a horrifying maw.*

**Keywords:** Head, Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** An overmind egg, the skin of any shapeshifter

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in the First Language

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 450

**Effect:** While wearing this grotesque mask, you can use a maneuver to cause your eyes to erupt from their sockets and multiply until six eyes orbit your head. This grants you a 360-degree arc of vision and prevents you from being surprised. Additionally, you have a double edge on tests made to discover hidden creatures, items, or mechanisms, but you have a double bane on Presence tests that don't use the Intimidate skill. As a maneuver, you can return your eyes to your head and make the additional eyes disappear.

While the eyes circle your head, you can use a maneuver to launch up to three of the eyes at one creature within 10 squares. Each eye you launch deals 5 damage to the target before it is destroyed. You can't reduce the number of eyes to fewer than two in this way. If you reduce the number of eyes to two, those eyes return to your head, and you can't use the mask again until you earn 1 or more Victories.

##### Mirage Band

> **Effect:** Each target is covered by an illusion causing them to appear exactly as any creature (humanoid, animal, undead, and so forth) an observer most expects to see. The illusion ends for all targets if any creature under its effect harms or physically interacts with any creature not affected by the illusion, if you use this ability again, or if you choose to end the effect (no action required). The illusion also ends for any affected ally who moves more than the distance of this ability away from you.

#### 4th-Echelon Trinkets

This section presents 4th-echelon trinket treasures in alphabetical order.

##### Gravekeeper's Lantern

*This ancient wooden lantern is inscribed with eldritch runes and stained with dark blood.*

**Keywords:** Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** The powdered jawbone of a powerful spellcaster, wood from a tree marking multiple graves

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Hyrallic

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

Trapping a spirit requires you to be within 10 squares of them and succeed on a hard Intuition test as a main action. Once a spirit is trapped, you make a Presence test to coax them into answering your questions:

- **12-16:** You can ask three questions, two of which the spirit must answer fully and honestly.

##### Psi Blade

*This wide metal bracer is set with a glowing gemstone.*

**Keywords:** Arms, Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** Steel alloy, one fine-cut topaz

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Mindspeech

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Agility or Presence

**Project Goal:** 600

**Effect:** While wearing this metallic band, you can use a maneuver to project a glowing blade of rippling psychic energy that extends parallel to your arm. While the blade is active, you can use a maneuver once per turn to make a melee weapon free strike that deals an extra 3 psychic damage.

### Leveled Treasures

Like trinkets, leveled treasures can be used at will without a reduction in potency. However, leveled treasures tap into their wielder's will in a way that trinkets don't, becoming more powerful and increasing their capabilities as you gain new levels.

#### Leveled Benefits

Each leveled treasure has benefits that you gain at 1st, 5th, and 9th levels. You can't use a treasure's benefit until you achieve the appropriate benefits level. Leveled benefits are cumulative.

#### Carry Three Safely

Your connection with leveled treasures doesn't just make them useful. It also makes them dangerous. Each leveled treasure is a quasi-sentient, purpose-driven entity. A magic sword wishes to be used in combat. A psionic implement yearns to unleash its powerful magic. As such, a creature can safely carry a maximum of three leveled treasures at a time. If you carry more leveled treasures, those items become jealous of one another and fight for your attention, attempting to subconsciously influence you into using them—and leaving your other items behind.

It's fine to own or possess more than three leveled treasures, as long as the extras are stored away or in the possession of other creatures. But if you carry more than three leveled treasures, you must make a Presence test during each respite:

- **≤11:** One of your leveled treasures (chosen by the Director) grabs hold of your psyche. It forces you to sleepwalk or otherwise enter an active fugue state and discard the rest of your leveled treasures in locations you can't remember. If you want those items back, you'd better get looking before someone else finds them.
- **12-16:** Your items work together to prevent you from moving until you pick three items and leave the rest behind.
- **17+:** Nothing happens.

<!-- -->
> **You Don't Need Three**
>
> Because you can carry up to three leveled treasures safely, it's easy to assume that your hero should always seek out and carry three such treasures. The truth is that many heroes find carrying just one or two leveled treasures a perfect thematic and mechanical fit, and have no real need for more. That's totally fine! You'll still be super powerful with just one leveled treasure, especially if you obtain or craft trinkets and consumables that might serve you better.

#### Leveled Armor Treasures

Magic and psionic armor and shields are the primary tools of heroes always ready to hurl themselves into combat. This section presents leveled armor treasures in alphabetical order.

**9th Level:** The shield's bonus to Stamina increases to +9. When you cause the shield to roar, you target one creature or object within 6 squares, you push that target up to 5 squares, and the target is slowed until the end of their next turn.

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Yllyric

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Agility, Reason, or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 450

**1st Level:** While you wear these boots, any weapon ability that deals rolled damage using your unarmed strikes deals an extra 1 lightning damage. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to speed.

**5th Level:** The extra lightning damage granted by the treads increases to 2. Additionally, for each square you move on your turn before you use a weapon ability that deals rolled damage using your unarmed strikes, this extra damage increases by 1 (to a maximum of 4).

**9th Level:** The extra lightning damage granted by the treads increases to 3, and your movement can increase that extra damage to a maximum of 6. Additionally, you can use a maneuver to perform a flying lightning kick on one adjacent creature. That target is pushed up to 5 squares, and you can move to any square adjacent to the target after the push.

##### Revenger's Wrap

*When first handled, this tattered cloak fills the mind with thoughts of revenge.*

**Keywords:** Neck, Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** A cloak worn by a murdered monarch

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Might, Reason, or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 450

**1st Level:** While you wear this cloak, any creature who damages you is marked for revenge until the end of your next turn or until another creature damages you. Any strike you make against a creature marked for revenge deals extra damage equal to your highest characteristic score, and whenever you damage a creature marked for revenge, they are also bleeding until the end of their next turn.

**5th Level:** Each creature who damages you is marked for revenge until the end of your next turn. Whenever you damage a creature marked for revenge, they are also bleeding (save ends).

**9th Level:** When you have three or more creatures marked for revenge and you target one of them with an ability that targets only one creature, you target all the creatures marked for revenge, regardless of their distance from you and even if you don't have line of effect to them.

##### Thief of Joy

*This burnished copper torque thrums with a sense of judgment.*

**Keywords:** Neck, Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** A pound of feathers, a pound of bricks from the Seven Cities of Hell

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Anjali

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Might, Reason, or Presence

**Project Goal:** 450

**1st Level:** While you wear this torque, you gain a bonus to Stamina equal to twice your highest characteristic score. Additionally, you can use a maneuver to choose a creature in your line of effect and learn their level. If their level is higher than yours, the torque grants you envy. If their level is equal to or lower than yours, the torque grants you disdain. You can have both envy and disdain from different creatures, but not more than one instance of either.

Whenever a creature within 10 squares of you deals damage to another creature, you can use a triggered action to expend your envy or disdain. If you expend envy, you deal damage equal to the triggering damage to a creature adjacent to you. If you expend disdain, you reduce the triggering damage by half. At the end of the encounter, you lose any envy or disdain granted by the torque.

**5th Level:** The torque's bonus to Stamina increases to three times your highest characteristic score. Additionally, when you use the torque's maneuver and the target creature is the same level as you, you gain your choice of envy or disdain.

**9th Level:** The torque's bonus to Stamina increases to five times your highest characteristic score. Additionally, you can have multiple instances of envy and disdain, with no limit on either.

### Artifacts

Artifacts are powerful treasures, with entire campaigns to be built around finding, using, hiding, protecting, or destroying one. Make no mistake—these items unbalance the game. If the heroes or villains have access to such a treasure, their power is far beyond what the encounter—building guidelines in *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)* expect. That's part of the fun!

Typically, one creature never holds onto an artifact for too long. Most of these treasures have a sentience of their own and an eagerness to move on. Since many powerful entities might want to get their hands on an artifact, characters might see armies, dragons, and even gods come to collect one from a wielder who refuses to let go.

##### Blade of a Thousand Years

*This fabled sword features a hilt made of glittering starlight, out of which its gleaming metal blade extends.*

**Keywords:** Magic; Light Weapon, Medium Weapon, or Heavy Weapon

Whether drawn from a stone, gifted by a lake spirit, forged by a god, or used to kill one, there is a sword that exists outside of time and space. It is always where it needs to be precisely when it needs to be there then is gone in a flash when the need for it has waned. The sword is depicted in art, song, and story across many living cultures—and even more frequently among cultures long buried, often after proving the deciding factor in a battle. It's been wielded by numerous heroes of legend, and even more who have slipped into the forgotten shadows of history.

Though its size and make are often debated, the sword is consistently described as having a crossguard made from pure starlight. When wielded, a brilliant metal blade springs forth from that hilt, suiting the holder's taste in weapons. Those who touch the blade are filled with the vigor and power of the heroes who have held it before.

**Suited for Victory:** This sword takes on the size, shape, and make that the wielder wills into it. It can be a light, medium, or heavy weapon, and you can change its weapon type and appearance as a free maneuver. Any weapon ability that deals rolled damage using the Blade of a Thousand Years gains a +5 damage bonus, and that ability always deals holy damage. Any creature with weakness to holy damage who takes damage from this weapon is also frightened and weakened until the end of their next turn.

**Rally the Righteous:** This blade fills all around it with hope and courage. Each ally within 1 mile of the weapon gains an edge on weapon abilities and magic abilities, and has damage immunity 5. Additionally, each such creature's Stamina maximum increases by 15 and they gain a +15 bonus to Stamina when this ability first affects them.

**Turn the Tide:** Each enemy minion within 1 mile of the sword is dazed. Any enemy leader or solo creature in that area takes a bane on ability rolls.

**Victory's Assurance:** This weapon always appears on the eve before what will later come to be known as a historic battle. It disappears after 24 hours or when the battle is won, whichever comes first. By taking the blade, the wielder unwittingly enters into a pact with the weapon. If they don't secure victory against monumental odds or some great foe by the time the sword disappears, they are pulled into the sword, preventing any chance of resurrection, and forever dooming them to lend their strength to the heroes of other ages.

**Soul of the Martyr:** If the wielder dies while holding this blade, their soul is drawn into the starlight hilt, where it remains for the rest of time to prevent any chance of resurrection. The sword disappears, but the lingering feeling of hope that spreads from it remains. For the next hour, the effects of Rally the Righteous increase to provide a double edge on weapon abilities and magic abilities, damage immunity 10, an increase to Stamina maximum of 30, and a bonus to Stamina of +30.

##### Encepter

*A bejeweled scepter with a spiraling porcelain handle balances an orb of light above its crown.*

**Keywords:** Magic

This scepter waits high in the sky, resting within an endlessly raging cyclone. It waits for the one who will unify all people under its light. It awaits its champion.

The Encepter is said to have first manifested in a young world doomed to apocalypse—unless every last inhabitant of that world could stand together. The scepter is said to impose either dominion or obliteration over any threat its light is drawn around. Today, it is most commonly known as a bad omen, and should the Encepter reveal itself, folk know that the world teeters on the brink of destruction. Whether any of the stories are true, few can say, for the only living eyes that have witnessed the Encepter belong to dragons deep in slumber.

**Shining Presence:** The one who wields the Encepter is always cast in a brilliant glow. Any power roll made by the wielder that uses Presence automatically achieves a tier 3 outcome, though the wielder can still roll in an attempt to score a critical success or critical hit.

**Champion's Lasso:** As a free maneuver, the wielder of the scepter can trigger a glowing line of light that traces their path as they move, or can dismiss the glowing line. If the wielder crosses over this line, each creature and object of the wielder's choice enclosed inside the line and within 2 squares above and below it are considered lassoed by the Encepter. Creatures remain lassoed until the lasso is released or until a new line is drawn.

**Dominion:** Each creature lassoed by the Encepter is restrained and can't teleport. A creature caught in midair while lassoed stays in place rather than falling.

**Obliteration:** As a main action, the wielder raises the Encepter to the sky. Each target lassoed by the Encepter erupts in a prismatic burst of light, taking 10 psychic damage for each square horizontally encircled by the lasso. The lasso is then immediately released.

**At World's End:** If the Encepter was not taken from its cyclonic resting place with the purpose of vanquishing a terrible peril, then a terrible peril emerges to threaten the world within 3 days of the scepter being taken.

##### Mortal Coil

*This floating helix of golden metal spins ever faster as it activates, crackling with crimson sparks.*

**Keywords:** Psionic

Change is the engine of existence. Permanence begets stagnation. When the past refuses to relinquish control, a path must be cleared for the future. Energized by the flickering of minds and souls passing through the void, the Mortal Coil taps into the entropic potential inherent in every living creature to cast a shadow capable of felling even gods. For the true gift of life is death, and gifts are meant to be given.

Only one destined for death can contain the power of the Mortal Coil. A mortal creature who carries this artifact serves as its host, gaining an additional main action on each of their turns, aging at ten times the usual rate, and becoming unable to ever regain Stamina. A host with no natural maximum lifespan permanently reduces their Stamina maximum by 10 each year.

When the Mortal Coil is left unattended or is in the possession of a creature who is not mortal, it activates and can't be deactivated until a mortal creature becomes its host once more. While active, the artifact extends a penumbra of influence for 10 miles in every direction. Every creature in the penumbra is subject to the following effects.

**One Foot in the Grave:** Any creature in the penumbra has damage weakness 2 and can't regain Stamina.

**Get Busy Dyin':** Each creature in the penumbra ages at 10 times the usual rate, and diseases and poisons affecting creatures in the penumbra run their course at 10 times their usual rate. A creature with no natural maximum lifespan permanently reduces their Stamina maximum by 10 each year. Each creature can undertake one additional respite activity during each respite.

**If You Meet God on the Road, Kill Them:** Every non-mortal entity in the penumbra is granted the gift of mortality. Previously immortal or invulnerable entities—from planar creatures to the gods themselves can be killed while in the penumbra, though not necessarily easily. Any creature or entity who dies in the Mortal Coil's penumbra experiences perfect death. They are permanently, irrevocably dead, and no magic, psionics, or technology can restore them to life.

**Perpetual Motion:** If there are ever no creatures or entities within the Mortal Coil's penumbra, the radius of the penumbra doubles.

**Beneath Contempt:** Deities and their servants always overlook the Mortal Coil and its host—either unable to notice it, or not considering it a threat. If the artifact is somehow destroyed or unmade through godly power, it consumes a year of life from every humanoid in the manifold where it was destroyed, then reforms in a hidden place.

## Titles

Titles are special benefits earned by heroes through adventure and mighty deeds. Heroes must win titles—sometimes individually, sometimes as a group—by accomplishing heroic tasks. Titles are the record of a hero's accomplishments, forming the basis of the stories told of them in taverns or whispered in the halls of the mighty.

Each title comes with a new ability or other special benefit. By earning titles, heroes gain a unique set of capabilities that sets them apart from other adventurers.

### Title Requirements

Players don't simply choose their characters' titles. Like treasures and Renown (in the next section), titles must be won. Each title has a unique requirement, so that earning a title might mean your character needs to defeat a specific monster, research dangerous forbidden lore, or—in the case of the Monarch title—win a kingdom!

Titles aren't given out on a schedule. Instead, the Director grants one whenever heroes perform a deed worthy of it. Just as a hero doesn't automatically find a magic weapon simply because they meet the requirements for using it, they don't automatically earn a title unless it's granted by the Director.

Although the Director gives out titles, if you want to earn a specific title, let your Director know. For instance, you might say, "I'm interested in the Dragon Blooded title. Can my hero listen for rumors of any wicked dragons nearby that need smiting?" Having ambition is good! Pursue the titles you want that will make you a better hero.

### Title Echelons

Each title is assigned to an echelon of play where it is most likely to be earned. For instance, knighthood is something that can be typically earned by the 2nd echelon, but becoming a monarch can usually only be achieved in the 4th echelon. But don't let the rules get in the way of a good story! If the Director decides that your character somehow wins a knighthood at 1st level, bask in the glory of this great accomplishment.

<!-- -->
> For the Director: Granting Titles Early
>
> Granting titles before characters reach the recommended echelon can be fun, but it's worth noting that doing so might have unwanted effects on the game. Higher-echelon titles often grant more significant benefits than lower-echelon titles. If a hero becomes queen at 1st level, her royal responsibilities might overshadow her other adventures. Don't grant a title more than one echelon early unless you know what you're getting yourself into!

### Customizing Titles

This section details a number of ready-to-use titles. But the Director can also create custom titles, both to reward specific player accomplishments and to flesh out organizations, locations, and foes within their own game world. When a hero finally achieves a long-term goal after many game sessions of struggle, the Director can memorialize the moment by granting a unique title. Similarly, the Director can grant custom titles when the heroes befriend specific factions, defeat notorious villains, or learn new moves from skilled NPCs.

The easiest way to create custom titles is to modify an existing title's requirements to fit the adventure at hand. For instance, your world might contain a secretive organization of freedom fighters—the Jesters—who never carry weapons, defeating foes with unarmed attacks and improvised weapons. Creating a Jester title can be as easy as modifying the Brawler title by changing its requirements to "Fight alongside the Jesters against a mutual foe."

<!-- -->
> **For the Director: Perks as Custom Titles**
>
> You can turn a perk into a 1st-echelon title simply by giving it a prerequisite (see Chapter 7: Perks). For example, a hero might gain the Familiar perk as a title instead if they complete a quest for an archmage, who then teaches the hero the conjuring ritual as a reward.

### How Many Titles?

Just because a hero meets the prerequisite for a title doesn't mean it is granted to them. The Director decides when a hero earns a title and its benefits. Odds are you'll be adventuring quite a bit and qualify for more than a few, but gaining too many titles all at once can make for a complicated hero. In general, a hero typically earns one title per echelon of play, though they can earn more or fewer at the Director's discretion.

### Title Benefits

Some titles have only one benefit. These are typically earned by heroes individually instead of together as a group. Only the hero doing the studying or meeting a particular fate reaps the reward!

Most titles, however, are earned by all the heroes at once for accomplishing a great task, benefiting them all. These titles typically offer a selection of three or four different options. When the party earns the title, each player decides which benefit their hero takes. For instance, if the party triumphs in a tavern fight and gains the Brawler title, one hero might become more adept at fighting with improvised weapons, another might learn a special dodge to use when flanked by multiple enemies, and two others might simply revel in the increased notoriety. A hero can take any of a title's benefits they qualify for, and multiple heroes can take the same benefit.

### Granting Titles

Titles are rewards for heroic activities, and they often go hand in hand with treasure and other goodies. If the party defeats a fearsome monster and earns Renown, or accomplishes a quest and wins a magic leveled treasure, one or more characters might earn a title at the same time.

There is no hard-and-fast rule for the number of titles characters should accumulate by a certain level. If a character wins a title whenever they accomplish a truly notable deed—once every few adventures—then they might earn about one title per echelon. Sticking to this rate isn't a requirement, though. Characters might easily earn twice or half as many titles, making them a bit more or less powerful than they otherwise would be. A Director can even skip granting titles altogether if they wish.

### 1st-Echelon Titles

Titles suitable for 1st-echelon characters are presented in alphabetical order.

<!-- -->
> **Optional Rule: Players Choose Titles**
>
> If the Director doesn't want to track player accomplishments, they can let the players do it instead. In this case, whenever a hero enters a new echelon of play, they gain one title of their choice for which they qualify.

<!-- -->
> **For the Director: Planning Titles**
>
> While running a game session, it can be hard to track the heroes' actions and remember which titles they might qualify for. As such, it's easier to plan titles ahead of time. If the heroes might face a demon or dragon in an upcoming adventure, you can include the Demon Slayer or Dragon Blooded titles as potential rewards alongside that magic cloak or psionic dagger. You can even use titles to inspire adventures. What challenges should a hero face to earn the Demigod title?

#### Ancient Loremaster

*It's astonishing what you find in old books. Look at this—nearly complete schematics for a war automaton, gathering dust because nobody here reads Zaliac.*

**Prerequisite:** You find a trove of forgotten books.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Leverage:* You know a priceless secret. The Director chooses the type of person who would value this secret—usually a member of a particular faction, such as a Higaran noble, or a type of person, such as a fence of stolen goods. When engaged in a negotiation with this type of person, you can offer this secret. If they accept, their interest increases by 3 (to a maximum of 5). You can share this secret only once.
- *Rare Books:* You add rare, ancient books to your collection. Whenever you undertake a research project, roll 1d6 for each dead language you know and add the total to the project roll.
- *Susurrus Codex:* You find a sinister book that whispers advice in a voice no one else can hear. As long as you follow the book's advice, you gain an edge on Reason tests and take a bane on Presence tests. You can stop following the book's advice at any time, but the book won't speak to you for the rest of the day.

#### Battleaxe Diplomat

*We seem to be equals in might and combat prowess. Perhaps we should bandy words awhile instead.*

**Prerequisite:** You gain the friendship or alliance of a creature you once battled.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Furniture Fighter:* When you use a weapon ability with an improvised weapon or a weapon that isn't part of your kit, the ability benefits from your kit's melee weapon damage bonus.
- *Headbutt:* While you are grabbed or restrained, your free strikes don't take a bane when those conditions would impose one.
- *If I Wanted You Dead, You'd Be Dead:* Whenever you defeat foes without killing any of them (including the foes you defeat to meet the prerequisite for this title), you gain an edge on tests during negotiations with those foes.

#### City Rat

*Stay out all night, visit the dives. Get in a fight, run from the cops. That's the real city.*

**Prerequisite:** You have spent at least five respites in a metropolis.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Discerning Shopper:* When looking for an item prerequisite for a crafting project, you can remember meeting someone who might have the item—or at least information about it.
- *One with the Crowd:* While you're using one or more creatures as cover, you gain an edge on tests made to hide and sneak.
- *Street Smart:* While in a settlement, you can't be surprised.

#### Doomed

*I don't know what it meant, but when I watched her die, I saw a vision. I watched her die and saw my own death. Am I losing my mind?*

**Prerequisite:** You aren't a hakaan but have witnessed the death of a hakaan.

**Effect:** You aren't destined for a meaningful death, but you still might achieve one. When you're reduced to 0 Stamina but remain conscious, you can become doomed. If you do, you can't regain Stamina, you automatically obtain a tier 3 outcome on tests and power rolls, and you don't die until your Stamina reaches the negative of your Stamina maximum. At the end of the encounter, you die.

#### Dwarven Legionnaire

*I have learned much. It might be your courage that inspires others. Watch your opponent's shield as well as their sword. And above all, stand fast, and do not yield.*

**Prerequisite:** You fight alongside three or more dwarves.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Close Formation:* While adjacent to two or more allies, you gain a +2 bonus to stability.
- *Rune of Alarm:* You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to inscribe a magic eye-shaped rune on a surface. The rune sheds light for 2 squares. The rune is dispelled 1 minute after it is activated or if you inscribe the rune elsewhere. The rune activates when an enemy comes within 2 squares of it. When the rune is activated, you wake up if you are nonmagically asleep, and you can perceive through the rune for 1 minute as if you were in its square.

**Prerequisite:** You join an army, guild, or similar organization.

**Effect:** You gain membership in a faction. You're regarded as a promising but untested agent, and you're allowed to operate independently. You can be assigned tasks to further your faction's goals, and you can expect rewards and promotion if you succeed. When engaged in a negotiation with any member of your faction, their patience increases by 2 (to a maximum of 5).

Additionally, the Director assigns you one of the following benefits, as appropriate to the faction in question. The Director can also create a custom benefit for a type of faction not noted here. You can use this benefit only in a settlement where your faction has a presence, and once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you complete a task for your faction.

- *Academic Faction:* You find a sage who can make up to three Reason tests to recall lore or make project rolls for research projects on your behalf. The sage has a +5 bonus to these tests. These project rolls take 10 minutes each and don't need to be made during a respite.

**Special:** You can gain this title multiple times, once for each faction. You can be stripped of this title if you act against the faction's interests.

#### Local Hero

*Your coin won't spend here. The Heroes of Gravesford drink for free in this tavern!*

<!-- -->

>
> Many titles bestow Renown, followers, and wealth upon heroes. Those topics are covered later in this chapter.

#### Mage Hunter

*Their power is dangerous. Unnatural. Someone needs to do something.*

**Prerequisite:** You defeat three leader or solo creatures who each have at least one ability with the Magic keyword.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Arcane Dampening:* When resisting potencies from magic abilities, your characteristic scores are considered to be 1 higher than usual.
- *Oh No, You Don't!:* Whenever an adjacent creature uses an ability with the Magic keyword, you can make a free strike against them as a triggered action.
- *Stink of Magic:* As a maneuver, you open your senses to the residue of magic. Until the end of your next turn, you are aware of whether each creature within 5 squares is a construct, an undead, or a creature from another world, and whether they have used a magic ability in the previous hour. Additionally, you can't be surprised by constructs, undead, or creatures from another world.

#### Marshal

*I said you had twenty-four hours to leave town. That was... what, about twenty-four hours ago?*

**Prerequisite:** You join an organization that hunts criminals, such as the Far Mariners (see [Orden and the Timescape](#page-24-1) in [Chapter 1: The Basics](#page-17-3)), or you are deputized to act for the local authorities.

- *Heedless Pursuer:* Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to deal yourself 1d6 damage that can't be reduced in any way. When you do, you ignore difficult terrain and you can increase the distance of any jump you make by 1 square, both until the end of your turn.
- *Silver Shield:* You have a badge granted to you by your organization. While you wear it, you gain the My Life for Yours feature from the censor class. When you use that ability, you can't spend wrath unless you have the Wrath class feature.
- *Trained Tracker:* You gain an edge on tests made to track criminals.

#### Monster Bane

*You dare mock Blunwin Mousebane? You think my deed trivial? Ah, but you didn't see the size of the mouse!*

**Prerequisite:** You defeat a leader or solo creature with a Reason score of −2 or lower, such as an arixx.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Beast Bane:* Creatures with the Animal keyword take a bane on strikes made against you.
- *Monster Soother:* You gain an edge on tests made to calm or tame nonsapient creatures.
- *Monster Trophy:* You decorate your equipment with a trophy from a creature you defeated. While the trophy is visible, you gain an edge on tests made to intimidate sapient creatures.

#### Owed a Favor

*The Guild's gratitude knows no bounds! We'll repay you in any way we can... short of actually paying you.*

**Prerequisite:** You successfully perform a service for a powerful faction.

**Effect:** The faction will perform one favor for the party, provided it doesn't interfere with the faction's goals.

Additionally, the faction is a good source of information. The Director chooses a skill from the crafting or lore skill groups appropriate to the faction, such as the Criminal Underworld skill for an outlaw gang, the Blacksmithing skill for a blacksmith's guild, or the Society skill for a noble house. While in a settlement where the faction has a presence, you gain this skill if you don't already have it. If you already have the skill, you instead gain an edge on tests made using the skill.

#### Presumed Dead

*But... you're dead. We went to your funeral.*

**Prerequisite:** You die in a way that prevents your body from being recovered or examined (for instance, by falling off a cliff).

**Effect:** While it might appear that you died, you did not. Instead, you regain 1 Stamina and can spend 1 or more Recoveries. Additionally, you gain a 1st-echelon trinket of the Director's choice (see [Treasures](#page-327-2) earlier in this chapter).

At a dramatic moment determined by the Director, you rejoin your party with an explanation for your narrow escape, and how you found your new trinket along the way.

#### Ratcatcher

*I like fighting these little guys. Means I don't have to waste money on a helmet.*

**Prerequisite:** You defeat a leader or solo creature who is size 1S or smaller, such as a goblin monarch.

> | --------------- | ------------------------------------------: |
> | **📏 5 burst**  | **🎯 Each enemy in the area hidden to you** |
>
> **Effect:** Each target who has P < AVERAGE is taunted by you until the end of their next turn, and you know the location of each creature taunted in this way.

- *Deadly and Big:* Your strikes gain a +3 damage bonus against creatures whose size is smaller than yours.
- *Everybody Move!:* When you use the Knockback maneuver, you can target one additional creature of your size or two additional smaller creatures.

#### Saved for a Worse Fate

*Drink this. You'll need all your strength for what lies ahead!*

**Prerequisite:** The entire party is killed or captured by sapient foes.

**Effect:** After being defeated, each character awakes, alive and with full Stamina and Recoveries. You are all captives of the creatures who defeated you, and a gruesome end awaits you—unless you can escape or overcome the nefarious challenge your captors have planned.

The Director chooses one of the following benefits, based on the fate your captors have in mind for you. Each hero gains the same benefit. Additionally, you must face an encounter, montage test, or adventure related to the benefit, as the Director determines.

- *Gladiators:* You must fight to the death for your captors' amusement. Your intended opponents wield or guard a trinket or leveled treasure, which you can earn if you are victorious.
- *Prey:* Your captors plan to release you and hunt you down, but it's no fun unless you offer a challenge. Each of you is given a medicinal draught that grants a +1 bonus to speed and increases your Recoveries by 2. This benefit lasts until the end of your next respite.

## Renown

As you accomplish heroic deeds, your fame allows you to influence NPCs and attract followers. Your infamy among your enemies also grows. Every hero has a Renown score that represents how they can use their reputation to influence others. The higher the score, the greater your impact with those who know of your legend.

At the start of character creation, your Renown is 0. Some careers can increase your initial Renown score (see [Chapter 4: Background](#page-67-0)).

### Increasing Renown

Some perks (see [Chapter 7](#page-241-0)), downtime projects ([Chapter 12](#page-307-2)), and titles and treasures (part of [Chapter 13: Rewards](#page-327-1)) can increase your renown. But for the most part, you earn Renown at the end of an exciting adventure, often after the acknowledgement of a powerful NPC that you helped save them, their family, their home, their organization—or even their nation or world. That NPC and anyone else who witnessed your heroics can tell the tale, and from there, your legend grows.

In most campaigns, the Director sets the characters up to earn 1 Renown per level, but some campaigns will feature heroes who are more or less famous (or infamous) than that.

### Influence Negotiation

Renown changes the way NPCs respond to heroes during negotiations (see [Chapter 11](#page-297-0)), whether that renown takes the form of fame or infamy.

### Attract Followers

Your Renown score allows you to attract and employ followers who perform different duties or favors for you. The Renown and Followers table shows how many followers a hero can have at one time based on Renown. You can always let go of a follower in your employ to hire a new one.

You can recruit followers up to the maximum your Renown allows as a respite activity, provided you are in a place or have a means of communication that allows you to recruit such followers.

###### Renown and Followers Table

| Renown | Number of Followers |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| 3      | 1                   |
| 6      | 2                   |
| 9      | 3                   |
| 12     | 4                   |

#### Stronghold

Many followers stay at a stronghold, which is a home base you designate and can change. Your stronghold is typically a location shared by your fellow heroes. It could be a few rooms at an inn in a sleepy village, an old castle you claimed after clearing it of monsters, or a fleet of sailing ships.

#### Follower Types

When you attract a new follower, you decide on their name and ancestry, and choose what role they play in their service to you.

##### Artisan

Artisans are crafting experts who can contribute to your research and crafting projects (see [Chapter 12: Downtime Projects](#page-307-2)). An artisan can contribute one project roll per day to a downtime project you choose, whether you spend those days in respite, adventuring, or other activities. They must remain at your stronghold or at the site where the project is undertaken, and must have access to the necessary materials.

When you recruit an artisan, choose four skills from the crafting skill group that they know (see [Skills](#page-268-0) in [Chapter 9: Tests](#page-263-0)). An artisan has a Might or Agility score of 1 (your choice), a Reason score of 1, and a 0 in all other characteristics. They know Caelian and two other languages of your choice.

##### Retainer

Retainers are heroic NPCs who adventure alongside the player characters. They are controlled by players in combat and are both simpler to run and less powerful than player characters. A hero can have only one retainer in their service at a time unless the Director deems otherwise. Because retainers and their stat blocks are combat focused, the Director can also decide that a large party can have only one retainer in total—or can't have any retainers at all—to keep combat from getting long and tedious.

Rules for retainers are found in *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*.

##### Sage

Sages are research experts who can contribute to your research and crafting projects. A sage can contribute one project roll per day to a downtime project you choose, whether you spend those days in respite, adventuring, or other activities. They must remain at your stronghold or at the site where the project is undertaken, and must have access to the necessary materials.

When you recruit a sage, choose four skills from the lore skill group that they know. A sage has a Reason and Intuition score of 1, and a 0 in all other characteristics. They know Caelian and two other languages of your choice.

## Wealth

Draw Steel isn't about accumulating and counting every piece of copper you acquire. Instead of tracking a bank account, the amount of stuff your hero can purchase is based on their Wealth score. As you accomplish more deeds, you acquire more treasure and rewards from grateful NPCs that allow you to be an even more effective hero.

The Hero Wealth table shows the types of items, gear, services, property, and more that you can purchase in the game. For a hero to make a purchase, the item must be available to them. Being able to afford a suit of armor or a stay at an inn doesn't do much good in the middle of a trackless forest, an empty desert, or a remote dungeon ruin. As well, the Director can also decide that a hero can afford only a limited number of purchases. For example, a hero with Wealth 3 can easily buy a small house, but that Wealth doesn't mean they can buy up every available small house in the local area to become a landlord.

The table isn't meant to be an exhaustive list, but you and the Director can use it to judge what your character can and can't purchase. For instance, the relative value of an ox isn't on the table, but you can reasonably assume that if you can buy a horse, you can probably afford an ox as well. (Don't @ us, farm nerds.) And if you can't afford something you want, fear not! You might still be able to acquire a specific good or service through negotiation, or by trading your heroic services instead of spending cash.

Treasures such as magic swords, psionic crowns, and even healing potions are rare to the point where they don't appear on the Hero Wealth table. Such items typically can't be purchased, and are instead found on adventures, traded for other treasures, given as rewards by NPCs, or crafted by the heroes.

### Earning Wealth

Each hero starts with a Wealth score of 1 that can be improved by their choice of career during character creation (see [Chapter 4: Background](#page-67-0)). Your hero earns Wealth whenever you find and keep a massive amount of monetary treasure, such as a hoard of coins and gems from a dragon's lair, or several unique and valuable paintings gifted by a monarch as a reward for a job well done.

In general, a hero earns 1 wealth every second level of play. The Director can increase this rate if they wish.

### Losing Wealth

As an optional rule, the Director can allow a hero to make a purchase that is one above their Wealth score. If this occurs, the hero's Wealth is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) after making the purchase.

> **Heroes Don't Do It for Gold**
>
> In *Draw Steel*, being a hero isn't a transactional job—it's a calling. As such, using the promise of treasure to motivate the players to accept quests comes up much less often than in many other games. Sure, the heroes need money to live, and some might even enjoy getting rich from their adventures. But money isn't the reason they put their lives on the line. Each time you create a hero, think about why your character answers the call to adventure—and make it about something more than gold.
