##### Slamming Into Objects

When a creature force moves a target into a stationary object that is the target's size or larger and the object doesn't break (see below), the movement ends and the target takes 2 damage plus 1 damage for each square remaining in their forced movement.

If you force move a creature downward into an object that doesn't break (including the ground), they also take falling damage as if they had fallen the distance force moved and their Agility score was 0 (see [Falling](#page-283-3) above).

> **Tracking Object Forced-Movement Damage**
>
> At the Director's discretion, mundane objects that are force moved into creatures or other objects take damage as if they were creatures. Sturdy objects can take damage as follows before they are destroyed:
>
> - **Wood object:** 3 damage for each square it occupies
> - **Stone object:** 6 damage for each square it occupies
> - **Metal object:** 9 damage for each square it occupies
>
> More fragile objects are destroyed after taking any damage.
