#### Criminal Contacts

You have access to a network of criminal contacts. As a respite activity while you take a respite in a settlement, you can ask a question of your contacts by making a Presence test. On a tier 2 outcome, you learn one piece of information that would be common among criminals—the secret entrances into a building, the location of a local criminal in hiding, the name of a local thieves' guild leader, and so forth. On a tier 3 outcome, you can instead gain knowledge that would be uncommon among criminals as long as such information exists—the location of a local treasure cache, the location of a murder weapon used in a noble's assassination, the name of an NPC secretly bankrolling a local assassin's guild, and so forth.
