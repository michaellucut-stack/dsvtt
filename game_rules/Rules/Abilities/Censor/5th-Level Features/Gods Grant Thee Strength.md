###### Gods Grant Thee Strength (9 Wrath)

*You channel divine force for movement that cannot be stopped.*

| **Ranged**       |         **Main action** |
| ---------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** The target ends any condition or effect on them that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of their turn, or a prone target can stand up. The target then gains 2 surges, can shift up to their speed while ignoring difficult terrain, and can use a strike signature ability as a free triggered action.
