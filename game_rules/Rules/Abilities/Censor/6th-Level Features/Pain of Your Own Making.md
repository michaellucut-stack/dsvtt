###### Pain of Your Own Making (9 Wrath)

*You reverse the effects from an evildoer.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |      **Free triggered** |

| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Trigger:** The target gains a condition or effect that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of their turn.

**Effect:** The effect ends on the target and is applied to the creature who imposed the effect on them. That creature also takes damage equal to three times your Presence score.
