###### With My Blessing (5 Wrath)

*A word in prayer, and the gods show the way.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |         **Main action** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** The target can use a free triggered action to use a strike signature ability or a strike heroic ability, and has a double edge on that ability. If a heroic ability is chosen, reduce its Heroic Resource cost by 3 (to a minimum cost of 0).
