###### Arrest (5 Wrath)

*"I got you, you son of a bitch."*

| **Magic, Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                   | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 6 + M holy damage; grabbed
- **12-16:** 9 + M holy damage; grabbed
- **17+:** 13 + M holy damage; grabbed

**Effect:** If the target makes a strike against a creature while grabbed this way, you can spend 3 wrath to deal holy damage to them equal to your Presence score, then change the target of the strike to another target within the strike's distance.
