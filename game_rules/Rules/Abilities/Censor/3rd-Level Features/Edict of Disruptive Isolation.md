###### Edict of Disruptive Isolation (7 Wrath)

*The evil within your foes detonates with holy fire that burns only the guilty.*

| **Area, Magic** |                  **Maneuver** |
| --------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 2 aura**   | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, each target takes holy damage equal to your Presence score at the end of each of your turns. A target takes an extra 2d6 holy damage if they are judged by you or if they are adjacent to any enemy.
