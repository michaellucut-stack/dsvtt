###### Fulfill Your Destiny (11 Wrath)

*You have looked at various futures, and only this one works.*

| ----------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 One ally** |

**Trigger:** You or another hero ends their turn.

**Effect:** The target takes their turn after the triggering hero, and immediately removes all conditions and negative effects on themself. During their turn, the target has a double edge on power rolls.
