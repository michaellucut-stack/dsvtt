###### Blessing and a Curse (11 Wrath)

*The gods bless and damn in equal measure.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |       **Triggered** |
| ----------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 One creature** |

**Trigger:** The target makes a power roll.

**Effect:** The target obtains a tier 1 or tier 3 outcome on their power roll (your choice). You can then choose another target within distance, who obtains the opposite outcome on their next power roll.
