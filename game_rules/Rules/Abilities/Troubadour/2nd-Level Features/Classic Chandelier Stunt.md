###### Classic Chandelier Stunt (5 Drama)

*Audiences love this bit.*

| **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |                  **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**            | **🎯 Self and one willing ally** |

**Effect:** Each target can shift up to 5 squares, including vertically, but must end this movement adjacent to the other target and on solid ground. Each target can then make a melee free strike that deals extra damage equal to twice their highest characteristic score.
