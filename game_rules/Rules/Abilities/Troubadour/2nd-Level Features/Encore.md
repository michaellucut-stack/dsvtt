###### Encore (5 Drama)

*Again! Again!*

| **Magic, Strike** | **Main action** |
| ----------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Special**    |  **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** You use an ability that you have observed being used this combat round. The ability must have the Strike keyword, cost 5 or fewer of a Heroic Resource, and cost no Malice. When you make the strike, you use your Presence score for any power rolls, and any damage you deal is sonic damage.
