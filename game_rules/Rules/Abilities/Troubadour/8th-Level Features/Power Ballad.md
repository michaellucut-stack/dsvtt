###### Power Ballad (11 Drama)

*A song for the brokenhearted wraps itself around the target and blossoms into a ward of thorns.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, whenever the target takes damage while winded, they can use a free triggered action to deal half the damage they took to the source of the damage.
