###### Epic (11 Drama)

*Your story tells a tale of the villain's waning power and how the heroes rose to the occasion to stop them.*

| **Magic, Melee, Ranged**    |        **Maneuver** |
| --------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1 or ranged 10** | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** The target takes a bane on ability rolls (save ends).
- **12-16:** The target has a double bane on ability rolls (save ends).
- **17+:** The target has a double bane on power rolls (save ends).

**Effect:** Choose one ally within distance. While the target is affected by this ability, each time they use an ability, that ally can make a free strike against them after the ability is resolved.
