###### Expert Fencer (11 Drama)

*If you can land the strike, the crowd goes wild.*

| **Charge, Melee, Strike, Weapon** |               **Main action** |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 3**                    | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 15 + A damage
- **12-16:** 21 + A damage
- **17+:** 28 + A damage; M < STRONG, bleeding (save ends)

**Effect:** This ability can't obtain better than a tier 2 outcome unless the target is at maximum distance. If you obtain a tier 3 outcome with a natural 17 or higher, you gain 3 surges that you can use immediately.
