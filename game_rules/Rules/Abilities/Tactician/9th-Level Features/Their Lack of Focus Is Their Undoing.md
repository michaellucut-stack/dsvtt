###### Their Lack of Focus Is Their Undoing (11 Focus)

*You trick your enemies into attacking each other and leave them confused by the aftermath.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Weapon** |      **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | -------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**          | **🎯 Three enemies** |

**Effect:** Each target uses a signature ability against one or more targets of your choosing, with each ability automatically obtaining a tier 3 outcome on the power roll. After resolving the targets' abilities, you make a power roll against each original target.

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** R < WEAK, dazed (save ends)
- **12-16:** R < AVERAGE, dazed (save ends)
- **17+:** R < STRONG, dazed (save ends)
