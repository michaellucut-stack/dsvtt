###### Blot Out the Sun! (11 Focus)

*What makes a good soldier? The ability to fire four shots a minute in any weather.*

| -------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst** | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** Each target can make a ranged free strike that gains an edge against any enemy marked by you within distance of their ranged free strike. A target ignores banes and double banes when making this strike.
