###### Floodgates Open (11 Focus)

*You direct your squad to strike in unison and with devastating effect.*

| **Ranged**       |     **Main action** |
| ---------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 Three allies** |

**Effect:** Each target gains 1 surge and can use a signature ability as a free triggered action. That ability gains an edge on the power roll and increases the potency of any potency effects by 1.
