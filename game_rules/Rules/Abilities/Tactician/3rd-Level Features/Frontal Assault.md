**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, the first time on a turn that you or any ally deals damage to a target marked by you, the creature who dealt the damage can push the target up to 2 squares and then shift up to 2 squares. Additionally, any ally using the Charge main action to target a creature marked by you can use a melee strike signature ability or a melee strike heroic ability instead of a melee free strike.
