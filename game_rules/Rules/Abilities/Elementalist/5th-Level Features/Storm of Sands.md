###### Storm of Sands (9 Essence)

*Dirt and debris swirl into a dark, pulsing hurricane.*

| **Area, Earth, Magic, Ranged** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 4 cube within 10**        | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 2 damage
- **12-16:** 5 damage
- **17+:** 7 damage

**Effect:** The area lasts until the start of your next turn. It is difficult terrain for enemies, and you and your allies have concealment while in the area.

**Persistent 1:** The area remains until the start of your next turn, and you can move it up to 5 squares (no action required). As a maneuver, you can make the power roll again without spending essence.
