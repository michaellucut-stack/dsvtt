###### Swarm of Spirits (7 Essence)

*Guardian animal spirits surround you to harry your foes and bolster your allies.*

| **Area, Green, Magic** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 3 aura**          | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 3 damage
- **12-16:** 6 damage
- **17+:** 9 damage

**Effect:** Until the end of your next turn, each ally in the area has each of their characteristic scores treated as 1 higher for the purpose of resisting potencies, and has a +1 bonus to saving throws.

**Persistent 1:** You make the power roll again to target each enemy in the area without spending essence, and the effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
