###### Motivate Earth

*The earth rises, falls, or opens up at your command.*

| **Earth, Magic, Melee** | **Main action** |
| ----------------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**          |  **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a 5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must include the square you touched.

Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that occupies 2 or more squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the structure where you touched it. You can instead touch an existing doorway or other opening that is 1 square or smaller in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.
