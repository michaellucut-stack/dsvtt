*Revitalizing plants and jagged stones grow, helping allies and hindering foes.*

| **📏 3 cube within 10**               | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the area gains the following effects:

- Once as a free maneuver at the start of your turn, you allow yourself and each ally in the area to spend any number of Recoveries.
- The area is difficult terrain for enemies.
- Each enemy who enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes damage equal to your Reason score.

**Persistent 1:** The area remains until the start of your next turn. As a maneuver, you can move the area up to 5 squares. This ability ends if the area is ever not within your line of effect.
