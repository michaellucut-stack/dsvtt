###### Fulcrum (11 Clarity)

*You precisely manipulate the creatures around you.*

| **Area, Psionic, Telekinesis** |                          **Main action** |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------: |
| **📏 Special**                 | **🎯 Each enemy and object in the area** |

**Effect:** Make a power roll to determine the area of this ability. Each target is vertical pushed 6 squares. You can target only objects of size 1L or smaller.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 2 burst
- **12-16:** 3 burst
- **17+:** 4 burst

**Strained:** You can choose to reduce the size of the burst by 2 (to a minimum of 1 burst) to give the forced movement distance a +2 bonus. You take half the total damage all targets take from forced movement.
