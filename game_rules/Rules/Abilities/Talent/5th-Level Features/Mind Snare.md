###### Mind Snare (9 Clarity)

*You latch onto your prey's brain and don't let go, like a song they can't get out of their head.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telepathy** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                       | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 10 + R psychic damage; R < WEAK, slowed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 14 + R psychic damage; R < AVERAGE, slowed (save ends)
- **17+:** 20 + R psychic damage; R < STRONG, slowed (save ends)

**Effect:** While slowed this way, the target takes 3 psychic damage for each square they willingly leave.

**Strained:** While slowed this way, the target instead takes 5 psychic damage for each square they willingly leave. You have a double bane on ability rolls made against the target while they are slowed this way.
