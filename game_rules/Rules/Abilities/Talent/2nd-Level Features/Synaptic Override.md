###### Synaptic Override (5 Clarity)

*You control an enemy's nervous system. How pleasant for them.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Telepathy** |  **Main action** |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**               | **🎯 One enemy** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** The target makes a free strike against one enemy of your choice.
- **12-16:** The target shifts up to their speed and uses their signature ability against any enemies of your choice.
- **17+:** The target moves up to their speed and uses their signature ability against any enemies of your choice.

**Effect:** You control the target's movement. The target can't be moved in a way that would harm them (such as over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a condition or other negative effect. However, you can move them to provoke opportunity attacks.

**Strained:** You take 1d6 damage and are weakened until the end of your turn.
