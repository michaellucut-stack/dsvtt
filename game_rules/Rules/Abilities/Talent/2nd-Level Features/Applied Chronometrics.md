###### Applied Chronometrics (5 Clarity)

*Time slows down around you. Your heartbeat is the only gauge of the extra moments you've gained.*

| **Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged** |   **Maneuver** |
| -------------------------------- | -------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                 | **🎯 Special** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** You target two creatures, one of which can be you.
- **12-16:** You target three creatures, one of which can be you.
- **17+:** You target four creatures, one of which can be you.

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, each target gains a +5 bonus to speed, they can't be made dazed, and they can use an additional maneuver on their turn. If a target is already dazed, that condition ends for them.

**Strained:** Your speed is halved until the end of the encounter.
