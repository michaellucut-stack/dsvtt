###### Overwhelm (5 Clarity)

*You overload their senses, turning all their subconscious thoughts into conscious ones.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telepathy** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                       | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 6 + R psychic damage; I < WEAK, slowed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 10 + R psychic damage; I < AVERAGE, weakened (save ends)
- **17+:** 14 + R psychic damage; I < STRONG, dazed (save ends)

**Strained:** You start crying, and you can't use triggered actions or make free strikes until the end of the target's next turn.
