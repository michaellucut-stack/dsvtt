*You raise the target slightly into the air, then smother them against the ground.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telekinesis** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                         | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 6 + R damage; M < WEAK, prone
- **12-16:** 10 + R damage; M < AVERAGE, prone
- **17+:** 14 + R damage; M < STRONG, prone and can't stand (save ends)
