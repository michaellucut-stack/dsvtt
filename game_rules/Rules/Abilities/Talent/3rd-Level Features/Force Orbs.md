###### Force Orbs (7 Clarity)

*Spheres of solid psionic energy float around you.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telekinesis** | **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Self; see below**                   |     **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** You create three size 1T orbs that orbit your body. Each orb gives you a cumulative damage immunity 1. Each time you take damage, you lose 1 orb.

Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to fire an orb at a creature or object within 5 squares as a ranged strike, losing the orb after the strike.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 2 damage
- **12-16:** 3 damage
- **17+:** 5 damage

**Strained:** You create five orbs, and you are weakened while you have any orbs active.
