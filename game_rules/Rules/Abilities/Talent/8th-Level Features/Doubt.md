###### Doubt (11 Clarity)

*You tug at the strings of the foe's anima and unravel them, allowing someone else to take advantage of their drive.*

| **Animapathy, Psionic, Ranged**, **Strike** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                            | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 10 + P damage; P < WEAK, weakened (save ends)
- **12-16:** 14 + P damage; P < AVERAGE, weakened (save ends)
- **17+:** 20 + P damage; P < STRONG, weakened and slowed (save ends)

**Effect:** This ability gains an edge against a target with a soul (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*). After you make the power roll, you or one ally within distance have a double edge on the next power roll you make before the end of the encounter.

**Strained:** You feel dispirited until you finish a respite. If you obtain a tier 3 outcome on the power roll, you and the target each have damage weakness 5 (save ends).
