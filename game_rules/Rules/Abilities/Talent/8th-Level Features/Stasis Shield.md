###### Stasis Shield (3 Clarity)

*You freeze time just long enough to bring the victim to safety!*

| **Psionic, Ranged** |                          **Triggered** |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**    | **🎯 Self, or one creature or object** |

**Trigger:** The target takes damage.

**Effect:** The target is teleported to an unoccupied space adjacent to you, taking no damage and suffering no additional effects if this movement would get them out of harm's way.

**Strained:** You can't target yourself, and you take the damage and any additional effects instead of the target.
