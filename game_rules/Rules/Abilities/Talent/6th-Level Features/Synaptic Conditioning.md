###### Synaptic Conditioning (9 Clarity)

*It's a subtle mindset shift. It's not that they're your enemy—you just don't like them!*

| **Psionic, Melee**, **Strike, Telepathy** |     **Main action** |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 2**                            | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 10 psychic damage; the target takes a bane on ability rolls made to harm you or your allies (save ends)
- **12-16:** 14 psychic damage; the target has a double bane on ability rolls made to harm you or your allies (save ends)
- **17+:** 20 psychic damage; the target considers you and your allies to be their allies when using abilities and features (save ends)

**Strained:** While the target is under this effect, you no longer consider your enemies to be your enemies when using your abilities and features.
