###### Synaptic Dissipation (9 Clarity)

*You manipulate your enemies' minds and make them wonder if you were ever really there in the first place.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telepathy** |   **Maneuver** |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                       | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** You target a number of creatures with this ability determined by the outcome of your power roll. You and your allies are invisible to each target until the start of your next turn.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** Two creatures
- **12-16:** Three creatures
- **17+:** Five creatures

**Strained:** The effect ends early if you take damage from an enemy's ability.
