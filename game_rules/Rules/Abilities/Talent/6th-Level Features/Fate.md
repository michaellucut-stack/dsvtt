###### Fate (9 Clarity)

*Your foe gets a glimpse of how it will end for them.*

| **Chronopathy, Psionic, Melee** |  **Main action** |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------: |
| **📏 Melee 2**                  | **🎯 One enemy** |

**Effect:** The target has damage weakness 5 until the end of your next turn. Whenever the target takes damage while they have this weakness, they are knocked prone.

**Strained:** This ability gains the Strike keyword as the vision hurts the target's psyche. You make a power roll, then are weakened (save ends).

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 8 + P psychic damage
- **12-16:** 13 + P psychic damage
- **17+:** 17 + P psychic damage
