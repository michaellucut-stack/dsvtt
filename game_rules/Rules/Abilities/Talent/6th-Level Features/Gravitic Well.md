###### Gravitic Well (9 Clarity)

*You bend gravity into a fine point and pull your foes toward it.*

| **Area, Psionic, Ranged, Telekinesis** |                             **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------: |
| **📏 4 cube within 10**                | **🎯 Each creature and object in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 6 damage; vertical pull 5 toward the center of the area
- **12-16:** 9 damage; vertical pull 7 toward the center of the area
- **17+:** 13 damage; vertical pull 10 toward the center of the area

**Effect:** Targets closest to the center of the area are pulled first.

**Strained:** The size of the area increases by 2. You also target yourself and each ally within distance.
