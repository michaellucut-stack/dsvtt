###### Greater Kinetic Grip (9 Clarity)

*You raise the target into the air without breaking a sweat.*

| **Psionic, Ranged**, **Strike, Telekinesis** |               **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                             | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** Slide 4 + R; M < WEAK, the forced movement is vertical
- **12-16:** Slide 8 + R; M < AVERAGE, the forced movement is vertical
- **17+:** Slide 12 + R; prone; M < STRONG, the forced movement is vertical

**Strained:** The forced movement ignores stability. You take 2d6 damage and are weakened (save ends).
