###### Incinerate

*The air erupts into a column of smokeless flame.*

| **Area, Fire, Psionic, Pyrokinesis, Ranged** |               **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 3 cube within 10**                      | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 2 fire damage
- **12-16:** 4 fire damage
- **17+:** 6 fire damage

**Effect:** A column of fire remains in the area until the start of your next turn. Each enemy who enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes 2 fire damage.

**Strained:** The size of the cube increases by 2, but the fire disappears at the end of your turn.
