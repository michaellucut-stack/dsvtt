###### Choke (3 Clarity)

*You crush a foe in a telekinetic grip.*

| **Psionic, Ranged**, **Strike, Telekinesis** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                             | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 3 + R damage; M < WEAK, slowed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 5 + R damage; M < AVERAGE, slowed (save ends)
- **17+:** 8 + R damage; M < STRONG, restrained (save ends)

**Effect:** You can vertical pull the target up to 2 squares. If the target is made restrained by this ability, this forced movement ignores their stability.
