###### Optic Blast

*Your eyes emit rays of powerful enervating force.*

| **Metamorphosis, Psionic, Ranged**, **Strike** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                               | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 2 + R damage; M < WEAK, prone
- **12-16:** 4 + R damage; M < AVERAGE, prone
- **17+:** 6 + R damage; M < STRONG, prone

**Effect:** When targeting an object with a solid reflective surface or a creature carrying or wearing such an object (such as a mirror, an unpainted metal shield, or shiny metal plate armor), you can target one additional creature or object within 3 squares of the first target.

**Strained:** You gain 1 surge that you can use immediately, and you take damage equal to your Reason score that can't be reduced in any way.
