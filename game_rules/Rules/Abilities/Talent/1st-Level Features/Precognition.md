###### Precognition (3 Clarity)

*You give a target a glimpse into the future so that they're ready for what comes next.*

| **Chronopathy, Melee, Psionic** |         **Main action** |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 2**                  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Ability rolls made against the target take a bane until the start of your next turn. Whenever the target takes damage while under this effect, they can use a triggered action to make a free strike against the source of the damage.
