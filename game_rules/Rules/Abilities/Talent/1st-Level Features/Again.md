| **Psionic, Ranged** |               **Triggered** |
| ------------------- | --------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**    | **🎯 Self or one creature** |

**Trigger:** The target makes an ability roll.

**Effect:** You can use this ability after seeing the result of the triggering roll. The target must reroll the power roll and use the new roll.
