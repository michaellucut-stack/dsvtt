###### Aura of Souls (9 Piety)

*A whirlwind of souls of the dead flies around you at your command.*

| **Area, Magic** |                     **Maneuver** |
| --------------- | -------------------------------: |
| **📏 4 aura**   | **🎯 Each creature in the area** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, at the end of each of your turns, you can slide each creature in the area up to a number of squares equal to your Intuition score. This forced movement ignores stability for your allies.
