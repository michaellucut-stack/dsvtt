###### Radiance of Grace (11 Piety)

*Intense light is emitted from your body, healing your allies.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |    **Main action** |
| ----------------- | -----------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Four allies** |

**Effect:** You can target yourself instead of one ally with this ability. Each target can spend any number of Recoveries, can end any effects on them that are ended by a saving throw or that end at the end of their turn, and can stand up if they are prone.
