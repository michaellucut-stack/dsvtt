###### Double Strike

*Why strike once when you could do it twice?*

| **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |                 **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**            | **🎯 Two creatures or objects** |

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **≤11:** 4 damage
- **12-16:** 6 damage
- **17+:** 8 damage

**Effect:** If you use this ability on your turn, you can use it against one target, then use your maneuver and your move action for that turn before using the ability against a second target. You still use the same power roll for both targets.
