###### Arcane Purge (11 Discipline)

*You focus your null field into a pressure point strike that prevents your foe from channeling sorcery.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                     | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 13 + A damage; M < WEAK, the target is suppressed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 19 + A damage; M < AVERAGE, the target is suppressed (save ends)
- **17+:** 24 + A damage; M < STRONG, the target is suppressed (save ends)

**Effect:** While suppressed, a target takes psychic damage equal to twice your Intuition score at the start of their turns, whenever they use a supernatural ability, or whenever they use an ability that costs Malice.
