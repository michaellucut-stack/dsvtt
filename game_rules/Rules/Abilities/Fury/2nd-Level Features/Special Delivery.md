###### Special Delivery (5 Ferocity)

*You ready?*

| **Melee, Weapon** |            **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**    | **🎯 One willing ally** |

**Effect:** You vertically push the target up to 4 squares. This forced movement ignores the target's stability, and the target takes no damage from colliding with creatures or objects. At the end of this movement, the target can make a free strike that deals extra damage equal to your Might score.
