###### Shower of Blood (11 Ferocity)

*You shock your foes with the brutality of your strike, resetting the balance of combat.*

| **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**            | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 12 + M damage
- **12-16:** 18 + M damage
- **17+:** 24 + M damage

**Effect:** Each enemy within 5 squares of you is distracted until the end of the round. While a creature is distracted this way, they can't take triggered actions or free triggered actions, ability rolls made against them gain an edge, and their characteristic scores are considered 1 lower for the purpose of resisting potencies.
