###### Primordial Vortex (11 Ferocity)

*You channel the power of the Primordial Chaos to pull foes to you.*

| **Area, Magic, Melee, Weapon** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst**                 | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 3 damage; vertical pull 3
- **12-16:** 5 damage; vertical pull 5
- **17+:** 8 damage; vertical pull 7

**Effect:** If this forced movement causes a target to slam into you, you take no damage from the collision and the target takes the damage you would have taken.
