#### Grab

A creature seeking to keep a foe close and locked down can attempt to grab a creature using the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Grab
>
> | **Melee, Weapon** |        **Maneuver** |
> | ----------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Melee 1**    | **🎯 One creature** |
>
> **Power Roll + Might:**
>
> - **≤11:** No effect.
> - **12-16:** You can grab the target, but if you do, the target can make a melee free strike against you before they are grabbed.
> - **17+:** The target is grabbed by you.
>
> **Effect:** You can usually target only creatures of your size or smaller. If your Might score is 2 or higher, you can target any creature with a size equal to or less than your Might score.

Unless otherwise indicated, a creature can grab only one creature at a time.

See [Conditions](#page-91-2) in [Chapter 5: Classes](#page-83-2) for information on the grabbed condition.
