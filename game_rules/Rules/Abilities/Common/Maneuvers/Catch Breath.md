#### Catch Breath

A creature who uses the Catch Breath maneuver spends a Recovery and regains Stamina equal to their recovery value. (See below for [Stamina.](#page-291-0) See [Recoveries](#page-21-3) in [Chapter 1: The Basics](#page-17-3).)

A creature who is dying (see [Dying and Death](#page-292-1) in [Stamina](#page-291-0) below) can't use the Catch Breath maneuver, but other creatures can help them spend Recoveries in other ways.
