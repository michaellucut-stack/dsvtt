#### Use Consumable

Unless otherwise noted in its description, a creature can activate a consumable treasure such as a potion with the Use Consumable maneuver. A creature can use this maneuver to administer a consumable treasure that benefits the user either to themself or to a willing adjacent creature. See [Consumables](#page-328-0) in [Chapter 13: Rewards](#page-327-1).
