###### Cinderstorm (9 Insight)

*You teleport your friends in a burst of ash and fire.*

| **Magic**      |                          **Maneuver** |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 4 burst** | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** Each target can teleport up to 5 squares. For each target in addition to you who teleports away from or into a space adjacent to an enemy, that enemy takes fire damage equal to your Agility score. Additionally, a target who ends this movement in concealment or cover can use the Hide maneuver even if they are observed.
