###### So Gullible (5 Insight)

*When your enemy strikes, you reveal you were in a different place all along.*

**Trigger:** Another creature targets you with a strike.

**Effect:** You use your Clever Trick ability with no insight cost against the triggering creature and strike. You can teleport to an unoccupied space within 3 squares of that creature and can make a free strike against them. You can then spend a Recovery.
