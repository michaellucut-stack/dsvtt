###### Machinations of Sound (5 Insight)

*Illusory sounds make your foes reposition themselves as they cower or investigate the disturbance.*

| **Area, Magic, Ranged** |                     **Maneuver** |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------: |
| **📏 3 cube within 10** | **🎯 Each creature in the area** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** Slide 4
- **12-16:** Slide 5
- **17+:** Slide 7

**Effect:** This forced movement ignores stability. Instead, the forced movement is reduced by a number equal to the target's Intuition score.
