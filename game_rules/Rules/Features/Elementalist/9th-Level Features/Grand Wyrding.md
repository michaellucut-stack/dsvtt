#### Grand Wyrding

You have mastered the magic of shaping a wyrd, and can use your Wyrding feature as a main action.

Additionally, when you have 5 or more Victories, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic. You have immunity all to that type.
