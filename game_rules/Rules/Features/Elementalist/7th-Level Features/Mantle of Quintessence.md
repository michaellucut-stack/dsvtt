#### Mantle of Quintessence

Your Mantle of Essence feature no longer requires essence.

Additionally, your Mantle of Essence now radiates magic that creates a calming air. Creatures in the area of the mantle's aura have their starting patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5) during any negotiation. While in the area, you and any ally gain an edge on tests that use the Handle Animals skill. If you have 5 or more Victories, the bonus to patience increases to 2 and tests that use the Handle Animals skill have a double edge.
