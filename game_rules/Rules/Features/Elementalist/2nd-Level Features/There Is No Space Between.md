##### There Is No Space Between

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### There Is No Space Between
>
> *Knowledge of the mystery reveals that two spaces are the same space.*
>
> | **Magic, Ranged, Void** |   **Maneuver** |
> | ----------------------- | -------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**        | **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Effect:** You open two size 1 portals in unoccupied spaces within distance, which last until you move beyond distance from any portal, end the effect as a maneuver, or are dying. Each portal must be placed at a height of no more than 1 square above the ground. When you or any ally touch a portal, that creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice adjacent to the other portal. If an enemy is force moved into a portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.
>
> At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or more portals are present, you and your allies choose which portal to emerge from when entering a portal, and a creature who force moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemy's destination portal.
