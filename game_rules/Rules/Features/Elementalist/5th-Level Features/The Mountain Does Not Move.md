##### The Mountain Does Not Move

You stand firm and magnetize your allies to stay grounded. Your stability increases by your level.

Additionally, whenever an ally within distance of your Hurl Element ability is force moved, you can use a free triggered action to decrease your stability down to a minimum of 0, then increase the ally's stability by an amount equal to the stability you lost. This change lasts until the end of the round.
