##### Master of Fire

The damage bonus of your Acolyte of Fire feature increases to +5 and applies to all your magic abilities.

Additionally, your Return to Formlessness ability can be used on supernatural objects (but not on artifacts). When you melt a treasure (see Chapter 13: Rewards), you gain breath equal to its echelon.
