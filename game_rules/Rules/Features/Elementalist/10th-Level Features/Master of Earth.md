##### Master of Earth

You have damage immunity 5.

Additionally, as a respite activity, you can shape the mundane earth around you in a 1-mile radius. You can open sinkholes, form mountains, level mundane structures or whole settlements, create canyons, raise islands or sink them in the sea, and perform similar feats. You can't use this respite activity if another creature within 1 mile is already using it. Once you use this respite activity, you can't use it again for 10 days.
