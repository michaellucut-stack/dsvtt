##### Stand Fast!

Your divine spark grows in power, allowing you and your allies to focus and endure. At the start of each of your turns, you can spend 1d6 Stamina to end one effect on you that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turn. Any ally who starts their turn within 5 squares of you can also spend Stamina to gain this benefit.
