##### Word of Death Deferred

You can stop death from taking your allies. When an ally within distance of your My Life for Yours ability dies and you are not dying, you can use a free triggered action to instead have that ally fall unconscious until they regain Stamina.

Additionally, your abilities deal an extra 5 damage to winded creatures.
