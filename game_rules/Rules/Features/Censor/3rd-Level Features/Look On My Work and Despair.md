#### Look On My Work and Despair

Your judgment has grown in divine power, instilling fear in those you condemn. Whenever you use your Judgment ability, you can spend 1 wrath, and if the target has P < AVERAGE, they are frightened of you (save ends). Additionally, whenever a creature judged by you is reduced to 0 Stamina and you use Judgment as a free triggered action, if the new target has P < STRONG, they are frightened of you (save ends). If the target is already frightened of you, they instead take holy damage equal to twice your Presence score.
