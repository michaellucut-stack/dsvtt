##### Lead by Example

Your devotion to your deity allows you to take command of the battlefield, letting your allies benefit from your wisdom. While you are adjacent to a creature, your allies gain the benefits of flanking against that creature. Additionally, your allies gain an edge on tests made to aid other creatures with their tests.
