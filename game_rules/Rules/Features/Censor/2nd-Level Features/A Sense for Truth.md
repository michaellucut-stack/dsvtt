##### A Sense for Truth

You are trained in secret techniques from your order that allow you to discern the truth with supernatural precision. If a creature is of a lower level than you, you automatically know when they are lying, though you don't necessarily know the actual truth behind their lie. Additionally, you gain an edge on tests made to detect lies or hidden motives.
