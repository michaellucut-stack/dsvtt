##### Impervious Touch

As a maneuver, you can touch an object with a size equal to your Presence score or smaller and place a protective spell on it. The object has immunity all to untyped damage. You can maintain this spell on a number of objects equal to your Presence score, and you can end the spell on any object at any time (no action required).

Additionally, you can place this spell on a building or vehicle (or a similar structure with the Director's approval) that is of a size larger than your Presence score. You can place the spell on only one such target at a time, and you can maintain the spell on a larger target and a number of objects equal to your Presence score simultaneously.
