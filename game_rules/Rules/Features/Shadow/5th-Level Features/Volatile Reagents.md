##### Volatile Reagents

Whenever you take damage, each enemy adjacent to you takes fire, acid, or poison damage (your choice) equal to your Agility score.

Additionally, your Defensive Roll ability now allows you to shift up to 5 squares, including shifting vertically. If you don't end this shift on solid ground and are not flying, you fall.
