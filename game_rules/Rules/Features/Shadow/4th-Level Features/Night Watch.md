#### Night Watch

Your sense for stealth shows those around you how to evade notice. While you are hidden, enemies take a bane on tests made to search for you or other hidden creatures within 10 squares of you.

Additionally, you have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Night Watch
>
> *A steely dagger from out of the blue knocks another weapon off course.*
>
> | **Ranged, Weapon** |   **Triggered** |
> | ------------------ | --------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 5**    | **🎯 One ally** |
>
> **Trigger:** The target takes damage from another creature's ability while you are hidden.
>
> **Effect:** The target takes half the damage. You remain hidden.
