##### Thunderstruck

Lightning and thunder infuse your body. Whenever you use an ability to deal lightning or sonic damage to another creature, you gain 1 surge. Additionally, if you use an ability that force moves a creature, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Intuition score.
