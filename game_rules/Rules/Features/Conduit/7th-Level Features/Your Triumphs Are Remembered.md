##### Your Triumphs Are Remembered

The gods allow you and your companions to bask in the glory of past successes. Whenever you finish a respite, you and any other heroes who rested with you regain 1 Victory after your Victories are converted to XP. This Victory isn't converted into XP at the end of a subsequent respite.
