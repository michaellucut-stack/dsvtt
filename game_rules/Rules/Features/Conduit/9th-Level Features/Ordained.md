#### Ordained

Your god elevates the power flowing through you. Your characteristic scores are treated as 1 higher for the purpose of resisting potencies. Additionally, while you have 5 or more Victories, you speak with the voice of your deity. You have a double edge on Presence tests made to influence other creatures.
