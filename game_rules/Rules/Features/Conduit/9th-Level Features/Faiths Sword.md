#### Faith's Sword

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose a willing hero ally who finished the respite with you. That ally gains the benefits of your Burgeoning Saint feature until you finish another respite. Additionally, you can spend piety as a free maneuver to give the hero 1 of their Heroic Resource for every 2 piety spent.
