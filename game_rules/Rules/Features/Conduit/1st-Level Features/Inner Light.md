##### Inner Light

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. You place a ray of morning light into the chosen character's soul, granting them a +1 bonus to saving throws that lasts until you finish another respite.
