###### Death Domain Piety and Effect

- **Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares who isn't a minion is reduced to 0 Stamina, or the first time in an encounter that a solo creature within 10 squares becomes winded.
- **Prayer Effect:** You inflict a deadly curse on up to two enemies within 10 squares of you. Each target takes corruption damage equal to twice your Intuition score.
