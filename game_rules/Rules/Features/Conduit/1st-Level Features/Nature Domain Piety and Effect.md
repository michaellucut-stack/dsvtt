###### Nature Domain Piety and Effect

- **Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that you or a creature within 10 squares takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage.
- **Prayer Effect:** Vines whip up from the floor or ground within 10 squares, wrapping around a number of creatures equal to your Intuition score. You can slide each creature up to a number of squares equal to your Intuition score. The vines then fade away.
