##### Piety Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs piety, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of piety equal to your Victories.
