##### Primordial Strength

Whenever you damage an object with a weapon strike, the strike deals extra damage equal to your Might score. Additionally, whenever you push another creature into an object, the creature takes extra damage equal to your Might score.

As your ferocity grows, you gain benefits as noted on the Berserker Growing Ferocity table. Benefits are cumulative except where an improved benefit replaces a lesser benefit.
