##### Menagerie

You can use all stormwight kits. During a respite, you can choose to swap your stormwight kit and still take another respite activity. Your Nature's Knight feature now lets you automatically sense the presence of animals within 1 mile of you. Additionally, whenever you make a test to track another creature, you can roll three dice and choose which two to use.
