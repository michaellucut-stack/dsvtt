#### Primordial Portal

As a main action, you can touch a magic source of elemental power and use it to create a portal to Quintessence. You can then use a main action to teleport yourself and any willing creatures within 10 squares of you through the portal and onto a safe island in Quintessence, or to teleport back again. You can maintain a number of portals equal to your Might score, each leading to the same safe island in Quintessence. If a portal in your network is destroyed, it is no longer part of the network. You can remove a portal from your network no matter your distance from it, including across different worlds (no action required).

(Exploring Quintessence is possible from your island, but continued safety is not guaranteed.)
