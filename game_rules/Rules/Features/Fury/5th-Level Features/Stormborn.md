##### Stormborn

You and each ally within 5 squares of you ignore negative effects from inclement weather, such as banes or environmental damage. Additionally, you can use the Blessing of Fortunate Weather feature as if you were a 1st-level conduit (see 1st-Level Domain Feature in the Conduit section).
