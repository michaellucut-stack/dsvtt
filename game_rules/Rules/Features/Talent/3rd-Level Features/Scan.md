#### Scan

You can extend your psionic senses beyond their usual range. Once on each of your turns, you can search for hidden creatures as a free maneuver (see Hide and Sneak in Chapter 9: Tests). Additionally, once you establish line of effect to a thinking creature within distance of your Mind Spike ability, you always have line of effect to that creature until they move beyond that distance.
