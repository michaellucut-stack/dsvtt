##### Distortion Temporal

While you are not dying, time behaves irregularly around you in a 3 aura. That area is difficult terrain for enemies. Additionally, when an ally enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there, they gain a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the turn.
