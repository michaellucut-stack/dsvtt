#### Telepathic Speech

You know the Mindspeech language (see Languages in Orden in Chapter 4: Background). Additionally, you can telepathically communicate with any creatures within distance of your Mind Spike ability if they share a language with you and you know of each other. When you communicate with someone this way, they can respond telepathically.
