###### Verbal Duel

Once on each of your turns while the target of your Foil feature is adjacent to you, you can use a free maneuver to exchange words with them. Make an opposed Presence test with the target. Whoever gets the higher result can make a free strike, which deals psychic damage instead of its usual damage.
