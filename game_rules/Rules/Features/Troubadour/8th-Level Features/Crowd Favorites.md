##### Crowd Favorites

You have the following performance abilities, which are usable with your Routines feature.

<!-- -->
> ###### Moonlight Sonata
>
> *Music pours out of your heart, filling the area with the utmost delicacy and without damper.*
>
> | **Area, Magic, Performance** |                **No action** |
> | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------: |
> | **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Each ally in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who is dead can choose to continue taking turns after death. On each of their turns, a target can move and use either a main action or a maneuver, but can't spend Recoveries or use triggered actions. At the end of the encounter, each target who chose to take turns this way turns to dust and blows away.

> ###### Radical Fantasia
>
> *𝅘𝅥𝅮♪Viras, my Viras, will you hold their hands as they cryyy—aaaiigh?♪*
>
> | **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
> | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
> | **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the area ignores difficult terrain, and any ability they use that imposes forced movement gains a +2 bonus to the forced movement distance until the end of their turn. Additionally, once per combat round, each target can use a triggered action as a free triggered action.
