#### Troubadour Class Act

Panache, melody, and depiction. Some troubadours have it all, but everyone starts somewhere. Your troubadour class act is your art form, summing up the manner in which the world becomes your stage. As you go about unearthing the drama of everyday life and strife, you choose a troubadour class act from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Virtuoso.)

- **Auteur:** You seek drama from story and recount, using your magic to manipulate the sequence of events unfolding before you. You have the Brag skill.
- **Duelist:** Drama infuses your every movement done in tandem with another. You perform dances of death, putting trust in your opponent to return your passion in kind. You have the Gymnastics skill.
- **Virtuoso:** You find drama in music and song, weaving magic between vibrations and filling the audience with your pathos. You have the Music skill and can play an instrument.

Your troubadour class act is your subclass, and your choice of class act determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.
