##### Blocking

You have the following performance ability, which is usable with your Routines feature.

<!-- -->
> ###### Blocking
>
> *No, no, no, you lose the audience that way. Try it like this...*
>
> | **Area, Magic, Performance** |                    **No action** |
> | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------: |
> | **📏 2 aura**                | **🎯 Each creature in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** At the end of each of your turns while this performance is active, you can choose up to a number of targets equal to your Presence score and teleport those targets to unoccupied spaces in the area. A target can't be teleported in a way that would harm them (such as over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a condition or other negative effect.
