#### Equal Billing

You can use your Scene Partner feature to form a bond with one willing hero instead of an NPC you interact with using a test. If you bond with another hero, you lose your existing bond with a hero.

Additionally, you and creatures you are bonded with gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. Whenever you or a bonded creature succeeds on a saving throw, you and each creature you are bonded with gains temporary Stamina equal to your level.
