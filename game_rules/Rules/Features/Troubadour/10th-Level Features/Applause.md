#### Applause

You have an epic resource called applause. Each time you finish a respite, you gain applause equal to the XP you gain. You can spend applause on your abilities as if it were drama.

Additionally, whenever you or a creature within 3 squares would obtain a failure or a tier 1 outcome on a test, you can spend 1 applause to improve the outcome by 1 tier.

Applause remains until you spend it.
