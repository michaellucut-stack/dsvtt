#### Command

You have an epic resource called command. Each time you finish a respite, you gain command equal to the XP you gain. You can spend command on your abilities as if it were focus.

Additionally, whenever you or any ally uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you, you can spend 1 command as a free triggered action to increase the power roll outcome for that target by one tier. Whenever an enemy marked by you makes an ability roll, you can spend 1 command as a free triggered action to decrease the power roll outcome by one tier.

Command remains until you spend it.
