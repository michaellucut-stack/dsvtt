#### Warmaster

You have mastered the entirety of possible strategies and tactics. Whenever you or any ally makes an ability roll against a target marked by you, the character making the roll can roll three dice and choose which two to use.

Additionally, whenever an ally uses a heroic ability that targets one or more creatures marked by you, they spend 2 fewer of their Heroic Resource on that ability (minimum 1).
