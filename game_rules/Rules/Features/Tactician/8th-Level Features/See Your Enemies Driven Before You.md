##### See Your Enemies Driven Before You

You have trained your squad to maximize impact and break enemy lines when they attack.

**Mark Benefit:** When you or any ally makes a melee strike against a creature marked by you, you can spend 2 focus to have the character making the strike push the target up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. That character can then shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score, ending this shift adjacent to the target.
