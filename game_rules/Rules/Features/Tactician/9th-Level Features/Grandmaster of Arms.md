#### Grandmaster of Arms

Your expertise with weapons has grown to true mastery. Whenever you use a signature ability from one of your equipped kits or make a free strike using a weapon from one of your equipped kits, you automatically obtain a tier 3 outcome on the power roll. You can still roll to determine if you score a critical hit.
