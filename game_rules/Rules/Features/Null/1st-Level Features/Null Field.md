#### Null Field

You project a psionic field of order around your body, dampening the effects of supernatural abilities harmful to you and your allies.

> | **Area, Psionic** |                  **Maneuver** |
> | ----------------- | ----------------------------: |
> | **📏 1 aura**     | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** Each target reduces their potencies by 1.
>
> Once as a free maneuver on each of your turns, you can spend 1 discipline and give your Null Field one of the following additional effects until the start of your next turn:
>
> - Gravitic Disruption: The first time on a turn that a target takes damage, you can slide them up to 2 squares.
> - Inertial Anchor: Any target who starts their turn in the area can't shift.
> - Synaptic Break: Whenever you or any ally uses an ability against a target that has a potency effect, the potency is increased by 1.
>
> This ability remains active even after an encounter ends. It ends only if you are dying or if you willingly end it (no action required).
