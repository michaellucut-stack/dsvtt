###### Undead Malice (Level 4+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 4 or higher undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (2-7+ Malice)**
>
> The undead activates a Malice feature available to undead of level 3 or lower.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Blood Hunger (5 Malice)**
>
> One undead acting this turn uses a signature ability against a creature who is bleeding. As a free triggered action, each undead within 5 squares of the first undead moves up to their speed and can make a free strike against the same target.
