###### Undead Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)

At the start of any undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Ravenous Horde (2 Malice)**
>
> At the end of this round, each hero not already adjacent to one or more undead is beset by two **rotting zombies** who burst up from the ground to appear in adjacent unoccupied spaces. Each zombie is winded. This feature can't be used two rounds in a row.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Paranormal Fling (3 Malice)**
>
> Up to three unattended objects on the encounter map rise to float 1 square off the ground. Each object is then pulled 5 squares toward the nearest enemy within 3 squares of the object.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **The Grasping, the Hungry (5 Malice)**
>
> Ravenous and rotting undead arms burst forth from 9 connected squares of a vertical or horizontal surface. Any creature who ends their turn adjacent to an affected square makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 5 damage; restrained (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 5 damage; restrained (EoT)
> - **17+:** 5 damage
>
> **Effect:** While restrained this way, a creature takes 1d6 damage at the start of each of their turns.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Dread March (7+ Malice)**
>
> Up to four undead in the encounter move up to their speed and can make a free strike. The number of undead affected increases by 1 for each additional Malice spent on this feature. If an undead is reduced to 0 Stamina during this dread march, they don't die until the march is resolved.
