###### Demon Malice (Level 7+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 7 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level 6 or lower.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Seeping Blight (5 Malice)**
>
> One demon acting this turn expels blight—digested soul juice—onto the ground around them in a 3 burst that lingers until the start of their next turn. Any enemy who enters the area or starts their turn there takes 6 corruption damage, and has a double bane on power rolls until the start of their next turn.
