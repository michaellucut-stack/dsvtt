###### Wode Elf Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of any wode elf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Forest Network (3 Malice)**
>
> Each wode elf who ends this turn hidden can shift up to their speed while remaining hidden.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Punishing Regrowth (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each wode elf gains an edge on abilities, and their strikes can slide a target up to 2 squares in addition to their usual effects. If a strike already imposes forced movement, this slide happens after that forced movement. A creature force moved by a wode elf's strike who ends this forced movement in difficult terrain is restrained until the end of their next turn.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Vines Everywhere (7 Malice)**
>
> Vines rapidly grow across the entire encounter map. Each enemy in the encounter makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 8 damage; restrained (save ends)
> - **12-16:** Restrained (EoT)
> - **17+:** No effect.
