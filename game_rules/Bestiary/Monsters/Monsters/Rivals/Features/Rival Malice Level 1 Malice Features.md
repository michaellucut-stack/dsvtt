###### Rival Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)

At the start of any rival's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Work as One (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each rival can impose a bane on a strike made against an adjacent rival as a free triggered action.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **We Just Do It Better (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, whenever any rival makes a power roll against the target of their Rivalry trait, they roll a d3 and add it to the power roll.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Check Out Our Loot (5 Malice)**
>
> One rival pulls out a magic consumable and hurls it, targeting a 5 x 1 line within 1 square of them or a 3 cube within 10 squares of them. Each enemy in the area makes an Agility test. The rival chooses a damage type and a condition for the outcome of the test from one of the following pairs: sonic damage and dazed, poison damage and weakened, or fire damage and frightened.
>
> - **≤11:** 11 damage; the condition affects the target (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 8 damage; the condition affects the target (EoT)
> - **17+:** 5 damage

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Calling the Shots (7 Malice)**
>
> Each rival regains 10 Stamina. Until the end of the round, whenever a rival uses an ability against an enemy, each other rival adjacent to that enemy can make a free strike against them.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Coordinated Takedown (10 Malice)**
>
> Each rival moves up to their speed and uses a main action or maneuver that doesn't cost Malice.
