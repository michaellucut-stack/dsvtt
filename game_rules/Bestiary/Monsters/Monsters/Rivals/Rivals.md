## Rivals

They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town's job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They're rivals—heroes just like you. Maybe even better.

Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)*-the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters' own heroic journey.

#### Rival Stat Block List

#### Using Rivals in a Campaign

These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class's fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won't be fumbling for a stat block. That's what rivals are for.

#### Rival Ancestries

You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.

#### Rival Abilities

Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)*), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival's signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival's level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.

#### Rival Languages

Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.

###### Rival Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)

At the start of any rival's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Work as One (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each rival can impose a bane on a strike made against an adjacent rival as a free triggered action.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **We Just Do It Better (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, whenever any rival makes a power roll against the target of their Rivalry trait, they roll a d3 and add it to the power roll.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Check Out Our Loot (5 Malice)**
>
> One rival pulls out a magic consumable and hurls it, targeting a 5 x 1 line within 1 square of them or a 3 cube within 10 squares of them. Each enemy in the area makes an Agility test. The rival chooses a damage type and a condition for the outcome of the test from one of the following pairs: sonic damage and dazed, poison damage and weakened, or fire damage and frightened.
>
> - **≤11:** 11 damage; the condition affects the target (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 8 damage; the condition affects the target (EoT)
> - **17+:** 5 damage

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Calling the Shots (7 Malice)**
>
> Each rival regains 10 Stamina. Until the end of the round, whenever a rival uses an ability against an enemy, each other rival adjacent to that enemy can make a free strike against them.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Coordinated Takedown (10 Malice)**
>
> Each rival moves up to their speed and uses a main action or maneuver that doesn't cost Malice.

>
> - Make Presence their highest characteristic.
> - Replace their signature ability with the troubadour's Cutting Sarcasm ability (adjusting it to target two creatures and deal extra damage equal to the troubadour's level).
> - Replace their second main action with Quick Rewrite.
> - Replace their triggered action with Turnabout Is Fair Play.
>
> You can also use the fury as a starting point for a censor by making the following changes:
>
> - Reverse their Might and Agility scores.
> - Replace their signature ability with the censor's Your Allies Cannot Save You ability (adjusting it to target two creatures and deal extra damage equal to the censor's level).
> - Replace their second main action with Behold a Shield of Faith.
> - Replace their trait with Lead By Example.

#### The Black Iron Pact

A secret society created to overthrow Capital's political and cultural structure, the Black Iron Pact draws its name from Ajax's sobriquet, the Iron Saint. Iron is a metal with deep symbolism to the tyrannical saint.

The five most powerful members of the pact—the High Command formally lead the society and serve as its strike team. The identity and whereabouts of the Black Iron Pact's original founder are closely guarded secrets, known only to Ajax and the High Command.

The pact's true numbers also remain a mystery, and many citizens work for them unknowingly. Such subterfuge ensures the pact's agents can't be traced back to the High Command.

###### Goals

The Black Iron Pact's primary goal is the conquest of Capital and the installation of Ajax as its ruler and god. The pact's agents are true believers of Ajax's gospel, which seeks change through force and violence. Their evil belief is that humans are the true owners of this world, and as such, only humans can join the Black Iron Pact, though the society employs nonhuman pawns when risk of capture or death is high.

Additionally, many members of the pact—notably senior member Erasmus and his wife Avalla—openly sneer at the idea of guilds (essentially scorning everyone in the middle class), and they object to anyone but a human man holding public office, owning any assets, or even learning to read.

**Running the Black Iron Pact**

The Black Iron Pact is an example of a 5th-level rival party. You can use the following statblocks, modifying each rival with the human ancestry.

- **Lord Erasmus Deseo:** Rival Tactician
- **Canon Athenodorus:** Rival Conduit
- **Cloak:** Rival Shadow
- **Lady Avalla Deseo:** Rival Elementalist
- **Qar, Master of Jackals:** Rival Null
