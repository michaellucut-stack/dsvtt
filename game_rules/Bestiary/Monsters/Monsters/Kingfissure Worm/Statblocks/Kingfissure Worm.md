<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Seismic King**
>
> The kingfissure worm has line of effect only within 3 squares However, they ignore concealment for creatures touching the ground and don't need line of effect to use abilities against those creatures.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Swallowed**
>
> A creature swallowed by the kingfissure worm is restrained and takes 1d6 acid damage at the start of every turn. If the worm takes 25 or more damage in a single round from swallowed creatures, they immediately regurgitate all creatures they have swallowed, who land prone in unoccupied spaces within 3 squares of the kingfissure worm.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Titanic Tunneler**
>
> The kingfissure worm can burrow through stone. When the worm burrows, they create a stable size 3 tunnel in the squares they move through.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Unstoppable Crawler**
>
> The kingfissure worm can't be frightened or knocked prone. While the worm is restrained or slowed, they take a −2 penalty to speed instead of suffering those conditions' usual effects on speed.
