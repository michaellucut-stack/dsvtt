## Ogres

Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life.

### Extreme Emotions

Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross, and one is more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart's desire, be it food, riches, or friendship.

Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place.

### Savory Stories

Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories always end tragically, each with a different villain—from deceptive mages to talking cats—swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs. The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences.

### Aristocracy of Bullies

When wicked ogres gather more food than they can stomach or riches than they can spend, they use the excess to tempt their kin into working for them. These petty rulers make other ogres grovel at their feet for table scraps, then send them out into the world to steal more. Many ogre communities form around these arrogant aristocrats—but few such leaders die of old age, as the ambition and emotions of their subjects bring about violent ends.

### Cyclops: Ogre Progenitor

Ogres originally descended from the cyclops, an old-world giant with a single eye whose kind still roam through remote canyons and valleys. These behemoths stand heads above the ogres and are twice as destructive once they've spotted their prey. But while their binocular cousins have gone on to become successful hunters and live for themselves, the cyclops is a scavenger hindered by their poor eyesight. Most cyclopses are eager to work for and defend powerful warlords or wealthy ogres, as long as they have easy access to food and shelter.

Rumor has it that a cyclops can emit a mile-long energy ray from their eye. However, focusing such power is nearly impossible when their vision is usually too irritated and clouded by dirt.

### Ogre Languages

Most ogres speak Caelian and High Kuric.

###### Ogre Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of any ogre's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

###### Ogre Lairs

<!-- -->
> One of the great tragedies of the ogres is that they keenly appreciate luxuries but are the wrong size to use most of them. Although ogres can guzzle fine wines and perch stolen crowns atop their heads, they can't fit into small folks' fine clothes, wield their tiny weapons, or sit in their chairs without smashing them to splinters. Nevertheless, ogres often decorate their lairs with costly furniture, decorations, suits of armor, and other prizes-sometimes in less than mint condition.
>
> The following are sample treasures from an ogre's lair, of which an ogre might have one or two. These items can be found in Draw Steel: Heroes.
>
> - **Treasures:** Giant's-Blood Flame, Growth Potion, Icemaker Maul
> - **Components:** A lead slingstone that killed a giant, a slaughter demon's horn (used as a drinking horn)
> - **Project Sources:** Notes in Low Kuric for the Thundering I weapon enhancement, notes in High Kuric for a Bastion Belt or the Devastating weapon enhancement
