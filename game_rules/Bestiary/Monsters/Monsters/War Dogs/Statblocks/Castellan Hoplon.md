> **Effect:** A 10-square-tall tower made of black stone shimmers into being in an unoccupied space that is 5 squares on a side. The tower has three floors, an entrance in the middle of each side on the ground floor, and a crenelated rooftop. Any war dog inside or adjacent to the tower has damage immunity 2 and regains 5 Stamina at the start of each of their turns, and war dogs inside the tower can observe through and have line of effect through its walls. This ability can be used only once per encounter.

> The first time in an encounter that Hoplon is reduced to 0 Stamina, he instead has 1 Stamina and gains damage immunity 10 until the end of his next turn. When Hoplon is reduced to 0 Stamina again, each ally within 5 squares of him gains damage immunity 3 and deals an extra 5 damage on strikes, all until the end of the encounter.
