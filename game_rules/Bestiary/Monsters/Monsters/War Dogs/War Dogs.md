## War Dogs

Ajax's war dogs—brutal patchwork soldiers—owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don't survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.

<!-- -->
> **Content Warning: Brainwashing and Body Horror**
>
> War dogs are explicitly evil soldiers built from the body parts of other humanoids. Check in with your players before running war dogs to make sure that they're okay with battling brainwashed soldiers with an appearance akin to Frankenstein's monster if he were built to be a shock trooper. If anyone is uncomfortable, modify the appearance and lore of the war dogs as you see fit.

### Withdrawn From the Body Banks

Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.

### Soulless Soldiers

War dogs aren't undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn't escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.

<!-- -->
> **War Dog Tactics**
>
> War dogs have a heavy focus on minion frontlines backed by captains with powerful control or support abilities. Those captains' tactics reflect the replaceability of their low-ranking troops, who they throw into the fray without caution. Once a squad of minions is reduced to a few stragglers, a captain will order them into position for maximum effect and manually detonate their loyalty collars.
>
> War dog captains are intelligent, well trained, and focused on prioritizing threats to their mission. Defensive and support units focus on tying up and slowing down high-Stamina threats while offensive units try their best to bully low-Stamina backline heroes. Unless ordered, retreat is not an option for war dogs.
>
> **War Dog Sample Encounters**
>
> - **Camp Patrol, 18 EV:** Eight conscripts, eight sharpshooters, one eviscerite, one crucibite
> - **Bodyguard Squad, 24 EV:** Eight sharpshooters, eight tetherites, two amalgamites, one phosphorite
> - **Scout Patrol, 34 EV:** Eight commandos, sixteen conscripts, two teletalites, two neuronites, one subcommander
> - **Oppressor Force, 52 EV:** Eight conscripts, eight sharpshooters, sixteen commandos, one pestilite, one neuronite, one ground commander

### Enlisted at Rebirth

From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax's war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.

Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax's ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars—unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges—and sent on to join a legion.

### Chain of Command

Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.

Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.

### War Dog Languages

Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.

### War Dogs-1st Echelon

The Body Banks are filled with the remains of enemies of the state, conquered peoples, war dogs who have experienced a second death, and even scraps of monsters and animals that might prove useful. Though the creation of new war dogs is by no means an exact process, the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks take great pride in crafting a highly destructive, single-mindedly fanatical army.

The vast majority of war dogs are simple amalgams of humanoids fused, stitched, and welded together with stolen Upper World technology and forbidden alchemy. Their unnatural origin is on clear display: patchwork skin, mismatched limbs, and unsettling proportions marking them as artificial revenants.

### War Dogs-2nd Echelon

War dogs, like any soldiers, are outfitted to carry out warfare with weapons, armor, and no end of ghastly tools. But Ajax's war dog forces are no ordinary army, and they bear extraordinary equipment.

#### Shrikeguns

The shrikegun is a new kind of weapon fit for a new kind of soldier. Each shrikegun is a rapid-firing bolt-thrower that replaces the draw of a crossbow with the compact energy of torsion springs. When loosed, a standard shrikegun throws a five-inch, iron-tipped wooden stake hard enough to reliably pierce steel plate at 50 yards. The stabilization grooves cut into the stakes create a shrill whistle when they are fired, leading to many less-disciplined armies breaking upon hearing the "shrike scream" of a loosed volley.

#### Fuse-Iron

Some war dogs use fuse-iron weapons that emit flames or cause explosions. While the exact properties of fuse-iron depend on its specific alloy and shape, the material is known for turning physical force into heat and light. Special arrangements of fuse-iron utilize crush cavities to create concussive detonations that are incredibly powerful, if not particularly reliable. Fuse-iron is expensive, accident-prone, and almost impossible to work with in large quantities, so that fuse-iron equipment is granted only to war dog specialists.

#### Houndweapons

Insubordinate war dogs are usually punished with a trip back to the Body Banks, but individuals who need to be made an example of are condemned to an even harsher fate: becoming a houndweapon. These living weapons are horrific blends of flesh, machine, and spirit create as powerful and terribly cruel tools of war. Only the highest-ranking and most capable war dogs can requisition houndweapons, given those living armaments' power and the time and difficulty involved in making them.

###### War Dog Malice (Level 4+ Malice Features)

### War Dogs-3rd Echelon

As a war dog proves their loyalty and gains the favor of their superiors, they might be rewarded with special attention from the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks, smoothing out their construction and supplying them with higher-quality parts. War dogs who have risen through the ranks this way pride themselves on their nearly ordinary appearances.

#### Happy Accidents

Making war dogs is more art than science, and happy little accidents can create war dogs with unusual characteristics. These war dogs are given great attention by the flesh sculptors, both to further improve the abilities of these deviants and to learn how to replicate their creation.

#### Made to Order

War dogs are most often made by playing the odds, with each new reurrection assumed to create certain ratios of infantry, mages, specialists, and so on. However, by radically altering their creation processes and providing special materials, war dogs can be made who bear little resemblance to any humanoid, and who possess power beyond that of any typical conscript.

These monstrous war dogs are developed to fulfill specific roles and combat niches, and are often fused with inorganic materials after their rebirth as living war machines. Monstrous war dogs are uniformly respected for having been chosen for greatness, and they consider their unnatural forms a badge of honor bestowed by Ajax.
