###### Gloom Dragon Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of a gloom dragon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Dread and Terror (3 Malice)**
>
> The dragon thickens the fog of their Gloaming Wyrmscale Aura trait and the horrors within it. Each creature in the area takes a bane on strikes made against the dragon until the start of the dragon's next turn.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Doleful Visions (5 Malice)**
>
> The dragon manifests four 2 cubes of nightmarish apparitions anywhere on the encounter map. Each creature in the area when it appears makes an **Intuition test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 14 damage; dazed (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 11 damage; dazed (EoT)
> - **17+:** 6 damage

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The dragon takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Phantasmagoria! (7 Malice)**
>
> The dragon summons macabre, disquieting phantasms in a 10 cube within 1 square that lasts until the end of the encounter. Any enemy who enters the area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 6 psychic damage, or 8 psychic damage if they are dragonsealed by the gloom dragon. Additionally, the enemy's Intuition score is treated as 1 lower for the purpose of resisting potencies until the end of the encounter.
