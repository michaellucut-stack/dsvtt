## Olothec

Protean in form, beings of nearly pure intellect, the Old Ones think in alien geometric logic. Their name for themselves is unrecorded, but sages believe they are the oldest beings in the timescape and simply call them "The Old Ones." Synlirii refer to them as olothec (*OH-luh thek*)-"ancient enemies." But some humanoid scholars have noted this term bears an uncanny similarity to another archaic synlirii word meaning "ancient ancestor."

### Immortal Evil

Across countless cultures and ancestries, olothec feature in nightmares and temple friezes alike. While their origins are obscure and may never be known, their hatred of the mundane world and every living thing in it is well recorded. Olothec channel psionic energy beyond any mortal power, surpassing even the voiceless talkers. To them, a living creature who can't reshape their own flesh is repugnant, an unnatural abomination requiring eradication—or transformation.

### Agents of Chaos

Olothec consider the primordial chaos that spawned them as the ideal state of existence. They have long warred against the voiceless talkers, loathing their constant manipulation and refinement of evolutionary forces. Where olothec lair in forgotten sea tunnels and beneath ancient ruins, they surround themselves with slime servants—humanoids, beasts, horrors, and others, all devolved to a perfect physical and mental state.

### Primordial Form

At first sight, an olothec seems like little more than a rippling mass of tentacles, twisting around each other like a shifting shroud. Creatures who get too close discover each of those tentacles ends in a ravenous mouth set with razor-sharp teeth. Each mouth is tipped by a cluster of three eyes that focus the olothec's relentless attacks. In water or on land, fetid slime coats the horror, protecting them against attackers and acting as a conduit for their fearsome psionic power.

### Mutations of the Flesh

Millennia of practice have allowed olothec to perfect psionic abilities that devolve and transform their victims into primordial life forms. Exposure to the psionic slime of an olothec's tentacles can change a creature into a mindless, oozing thrall. The most powerful olothec have unique powers that further warp flesh.

### Olothec Languages

Most olothec communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Urollialic. Many also know Old Variac and Caelian, but converse in those languages only when necessary.

<!-- -->
> **Content Warning: Body Horror**
>
> Most olothec are creatures of incomprehensible evil who use their psionic might to reshape the flesh of their enemies. Their stat blocks contain strong elements of body horror. You should feel free to modify any of these effects for the safety of you and your players.

##### Slime Servants

Slime servants are creatures who have been changed through the powers of the olothec. Their flesh devolves into a translucent primordial state, and they lose their memories and sense of self, becoming a slime servant NPC who is loyal to the olothec. The slime servant retains all their original statistics and gains the following traits:

- **Being of the Deep.** The slime servant can breathe air and water. Additionally, they can automatically swim at full speed while moving.
- **Dulled Mind.** The slime servant can't be frightened or taunted.
- **Servant Senses.** The olothec can sense anything the slime servant senses, and if the slime servant can speak, the olothec can speak through their body.

Only technology from the upper worlds, particularly products of evolutionary advancements made by the voiceless talkers, can restore a slime servant's memories and return them to their original state.
