###### Giant Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of any giant's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Hurl Landscape (3 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Ranged, Weapon** |               **Main action** |
> | ------------------------ | ----------------------------: |
> | **📏 4 cube within 10**  | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** A giant unearths a structure, hazard, or chunk of the encounter map and launches it to fill the area. Each target makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 18 damage; prone and can't stand (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 14 damage; prone
> - **17+:** 9 damage

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Bellow (5 Malice)**
>
> Each giant in the encounter takes a deep breath and yells, pushing each creature within 3 squares of them up to 10 squares. A creature who can be pushed by more than one giant is pushed by one giant of your choice.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Titanic Tear (7 Malice)**
>
> A giant creates a fissure along the ground, either in a 15 x 2 line within 1 or a 10 x 3 line within 2, and that opens up to a depth of 6 squares. Each giant in the area can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the fissure. Each non-giant in the area makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 10 damage; the target falls into the fissure, and is prone and can't stand (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 10 damage; the target is prone and hanging onto the edge of the fissure
> - **17+:** The target can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the fissure.
