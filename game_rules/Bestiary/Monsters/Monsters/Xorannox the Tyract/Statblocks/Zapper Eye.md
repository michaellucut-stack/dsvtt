###### Xorannox's Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of Xorannox's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Gas Belch (3 Malice)**
>
> Xorannox lets out a noxious belch. Each enemy within 2 squares of him who has M < 3 is weakened (save ends).

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Slime Trail (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of Xorannox's next turn, whenever he or any of his eyes leave their space, they secrete a viscous slime onto the ground in that area. Any enemy who enters an affected square has lightning weakness 5 and fire weakness 5 until the end of the encounter.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> Xorannox takes an additional main action on his turn. He can use this feature even if he is dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Mind Over Matter (7 Malice)**
>
> Xorannox fills the encounter map with a powerful telekinetic field. The Director chooses a cardinal direction (north, south, east, or west). Whenever a creature in the encounter willingly moves or is force moved, they are pulled 2 squares in the chosen direction, ignoring stability. Each time this feature is used, its previous effect ends.
