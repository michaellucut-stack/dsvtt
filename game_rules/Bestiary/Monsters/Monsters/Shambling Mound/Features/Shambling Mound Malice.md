###### Shambling Mound Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of a shambling mound's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Poisoned Vines (3 Malice)**
>
> The shambling mound seeps noxious residue from their vines. The next time they use their Vine Lash ability before the end of their next turn, they deal an extra 12 poison damage to each target.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Frenzy Lash (5 Malice)**
>
> The shambling mound lashes out at each enemy within 10 squares of them, driving them back or into the air. Each target makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 7 damage; push 7 or vertical push 3; restrained (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 6 damage; push 5 or vertical push 2
> - **17+:** 3 damage

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The shambling mound takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Leeching Wilds (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the shambling mound's next turn, the area within 10 squares of them is difficult terrain for enemies, and any enemy in the area takes a bane on power rolls. Any enemy who starts their turn in the area takes 4 acid damage, and the shambling mound regains an equal amount of Stamina.
