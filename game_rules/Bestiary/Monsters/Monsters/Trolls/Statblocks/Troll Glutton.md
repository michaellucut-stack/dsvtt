> **Effect:** The glutton shifts up to their speed in a straight line, ignoring difficult terrain. The first time during this movement that the glutton moves through the space of a creature or object their size or smaller, that creature or object takes 10 damage, or a creature can choose to fall prone instead. If the glutton moves into a creature or object larger than them and doesn't knock the creature prone or destroy the object, the glutton's movement ends and they are dazed until the end of their next turn.
