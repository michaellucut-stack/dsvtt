## Orcs

In a long-lost language, the word oruk-"blood fire"-described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin ("the people") in their own language, they also use "orc" with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.

Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They've settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers' than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.

#### Relentlessly Tough

Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they're excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.

Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with "blood fire," glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.

#### Innate Power

The intense power of an orc's spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature's spirit.

#### Mohlers

Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests—and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs' enemies off their feet.

When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.

#### Scyzas

Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza's trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.

#### Orc Languages

Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.

###### Orc Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of any orc's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Overwhelming March (3 Malice)**
>
> Each orc shifts up to their speed, moving through enemy spaces if they can. Each enemy passed through during this movement makes a **Might test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 6 damage; prone
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; prone
> - **17+:** Push 2

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Mohler Trench (5 Malice)**
>
> An orc acting this turn summons 2 **mohlers** out of the ground, who dig a trench that is a 10 x 1 line within 10 squares when they appear. The trench is 2 squares deep and is difficult terrain. The trench can't be created directly underneath creatures.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Mohler Cavity (7 Malice)**
>
> The ground shakes as a group of mohlers dig a 5 cube pit beneath an area where at least one creature is on the ground. The area is difficult terrain. Each orc in the area can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the pit before it is completed. Each nonorc in the area makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 4 damage; the target falls; prone and can't stand (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; the target falls
> - **17+:** The target can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the pit.
