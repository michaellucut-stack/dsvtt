###### Construct

Construct creatures, such as the ashen hoarder and valok, are manufactured, with magic or psionics playing a role in giving them life. A construct's level of sapience is determined by the will and skill of their creator. Some function entirely on their own, while others serve as mindless drones who take action only if given orders. Unless otherwise noted, constructs don't need to eat, drink water, sleep, or breathe to survive.
