###### Elemental

If a creature can trace their origin back to Quintessence, the Manifold of Elements, they have the Elemental keyword. This includes creatures of raw elemental power, such as the crux of fire, and creatures who merely trace some part of their origin back to Quintessence, such as meteor dragons.
